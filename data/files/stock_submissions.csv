**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

AAPL,Long $AAPL - New Apple M1 chip benchmark leaked,1605481537.0,"Apple last week released the following new Macs.

\- MacBook Air

\- MacBook Pro 13 inch

\- Mac mini

These 3 Macs all share same chip, [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). So Apple is no longer putting Intel CPU in their new Mac product lines.

&#x200B;

So you might wonder, how good is this chip?

&#x200B;

Based on the leak (and official ones will be released in 2 days when people start receiving their macs), it appears that the new MacBook **Air** destroys the last year's top of the line MacBook **Pro** 16 inch's performance in benchmark, according to what is listed on Geekbench. It also means that Mac mini, which costs ($699) stumps all previous MBP's performances.

&#x200B;

||[2020 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020) , 2020 Mac mini ($699), 2020 MacBook Pro 13inch ($1299)|[2019 Macbook Pro 16inch & CPU upgraded ($2999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-late-2019)|[2019 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-early-2020-intel-core-i7-1060ng7-1-2-ghz-4-cores)|[i7-9700k](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i7-9700k)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Single-core Score (Geekbench5)|**1717**|1095|1138|1289|
|Multi-core Score (Geekbench5)|**7380**|6869|3072|7267|

&#x200B;

I see that this leap in performance is far greater than what AMD did when they first announced their Ryzen1,2,3 product lines in past few years, and I dare to say that we might be observing start of new era where Apple silicon for laptop computer will be dominating over Intel/AMD going forward for next few years, similar to how their *A* series silicon in iPhone started dominating over all other mobile chips in smartphones, and the gap has not been closing.

The new M1 chip's single core score of 1717 [outshines](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks) all of consumer level CPUs, and its multicore performance is similar to that of i7-9700k. You need to understand that TDP difference between these M1 and i7-9700k chips are huge. M1 runs with 10watt\~20watt TDP while i7-9700k has 95watt TDP .

In short, laptop processor M1 is doing much work with much less energy (less heat) than i7-9700k, which is a desktop processor, and that is how Apple was able to release new MacBook Air this year without any cooling fans. You can't imagine running Intel i7 cpu without cooling fan. This just shows tech level differences and how much Apple was able to achieve by spending on research with billions in their cash reserve.

The M1 chip, without need of any separate graphic card offers GPU performance similar to RX 570 or GTX 1060. The intel's counterpart onboard graphic chip, Intel UHD630, has much worse GPU performance than M1, and they are incomparable.

Apple will be working on improved version of M1 chip, (possibly known as M1X), so that they can put them into MacBook Pro 16inch product lines, and higher end version of Mac mini, and I foresee that to be much faster than any other laptop CPUs out in the wild today, and on par with high end desktop processors.

Of course, the shift in momentum in userbase or AAPL's stock price won't happen in a single day or in single month, just like how release of the first iPhone or Apple's first SoC A4 (which were great innovations at the time but were incomprehensible for many fund managers, as well as to Warren Buffet) at that time of release didn't pop AAPL's stock price 10x times in one day or one month.

However, I think AAPL will be gradually increase market share in laptop computer markets over time, and also be able to make more profits due to simpler logistic (They now only need to produce/maintain one M1 line compared to having to embed 11 different intel chips, and having to work with Intel), and possibly expand their influence over to the desktop computer as well in the future.

TL DR:

\- Apple M1 chip dominates.

\- Buy $AAPL stocks in your IRA/401k.

\- Buy $AAPL LEAP call options 2022-09-16 at $120 strike price, and don't look back."

Real men and 1%ers carry their options through earnings and if you're like me, you're probably pulling out the old boy scout handbook on how to tie certain knots. Here's how we can save ourselves.

At precisely 4AM ET, we need about 1% of this sub, or 16,000 users to max out their margin (see *free money*) to go all in on $AAPL shares. Yes, shares. 

16,000 users maxing out $10,000 gives us $160,000,000 of **free** capital.

At 109.59 a share, we can scoop up 1,500,000 shares right at pre-market open.

This unprecedented volume will make other investors think that Grand Daddy Carl Icahn was very impressed with earnings and is going all in on a lame share YOLO effectively increasing the stock price to $150 and making all of us with OTM options rich enough to get access to the 2020 November Bull Massacre.

Facebook is joining the game streaming world, taking on the likes of Sony, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia. All now offer ways for people to play visually complex console and PC games over the internet, using technology similar to how Netflix streams movies. While most companies are focused on the top-tier games like Take-Two's action game Grand Theft Auto V or Ubisoft's upcoming Assassin's Creed Valhalla historical fiction title, Facebook says it's going to focus on mobile games instead.
Facebook's new service, which is part of its Facebook Gaming project, will offer people access to smartphone games like Gameloft's Asphalt 9: Legends racing title without the need to download or install an app. Instead, Facebook said people can play these games on a computer through its Facebook Gaming website or through its Facebook app on devices powered by Google's Android

Additionally, sales of the iPhone 12 might be benefitting partly from the longer lead times on the Pro, as highlighted in our iPhone Availability Tracker (see here). On the drivers of interest in the new iPhone models, which has been concluded to be better than iPhone 11 models by greater than 50% of sales reps across carriers, 81% of the reps see 5G being a key driver of the higher consumer interest – which bodes well for the orders of the iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Mini as well (shipping today). Separate from the launch, 97% of Apple stores are now open (vs. 86% in early October and 58% in early September) with Apple looking to expand “Express” storefronts from 20 to 50 in coming months."""

AAPL,Me after buying SQQQ before the election.,1604660849.0,
AAPL,"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",1605451463.0,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

AAPL,Yall sleeping on Tim Apple - the next Tesla,1606046506.0,"Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards

So I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.

AAPL is the next TSLA.

TSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. 

""Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout."" 

""If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?"" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)

""This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?

""This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.""

Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all 🍎.

Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. 

Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.

Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Also AAPL finished an A, B, C correction? Some tard with more brain wrinkles can explain wave theory. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?

""I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tangent about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost""

Shrooms are fucking amazing.

Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?

""What will be the catalyst?"" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.

""But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-"" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.

I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. 
 
Positions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. [AAPL 11/27 125C](https://imgur.com/a/dIAeU6p). Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.

TL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust."
AAPL,"PSTH, throw some money you can burn on this one",1606199100.0,"[Institutional ownership growing, what do they know that we don't?](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&subView=institutional)

Judging by Bill Ackman's statement to close a deal by the end of the year, there's something potentially in the card.

The structure of the SPAC is also shareholder friendly, so if it’s a good one, we will all make money.

What is definitely not in the cards: Airbnb, SpaceX, Wish etc.

What is likely on the cards: Stripe, Epic games, Bumble [etc.](https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/)

Most rumoured is Stripe. Which again, the Collison brothers have trolled about PSTH.

[Follow some of the rumours.](http://twitter.com/YoloCapitalMgmt)

[The OG post that got me interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jlwv11/psth_dd_on_my_24m_bet_11_downside_now_huge_upside/)

Ackman's following Stripe on twitter; Collison's doing Ackman.

PSTH seems to be in talks with them for some time.

Again, it is difficult to say, if it is Stripe or not.

What if it’s stripe?

If it’s Stripe, then you hit the jackpot.

Stripe could grow to a mamoth size(I am talking hundreds of billions of dollars) and there would be significant upside to it.

Stripe has been hiring people to go public, so that's something.

What’s the risk here?
Not much, considering that PSTH is not that overvalued. If it’s not Stripe, it would still not be a complete dud. As big investment firms have flocked to this one.

How to play?
Warrants, shares(my preference for now, after that you can sell CC) or leap calls(although the OI is not that high).

Personally, I would say, use some throw away money and see if it sticks.

Edit: [This redditors DD is a superb insight on why Stripe is the likely target.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/jy6m0i/dd_why_stripe_is_still_the_target_applying_occams/)"
AAPL,Fuck this game,1604076792.0,
AAPL,Berkshire Hathaway buys back $9B in stock in Q3,1604775269.0,"  

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:[BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B?source=news_body_link)) (NYSE:[BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A?source=news_body_link)) [bought back \~$9B of stock during Q3](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18075672-berkshire-hathaway-inc-news-release?source=news_body_link), bringing the nine-month total to \~$16B.

That's up from the $5.1B of stock the conglomerate bought in Q2.

Q3 operating earnings of $5.48B vs. $5.51B in Q2 and $8.07B in the year-ago quarter.

The only major business segment to see a Y/Y  increase in operating earnings was railroad, utilities and energy, while  insurance underwriting posted a loss vs. a year-ago profit. (updated at  8:18 AM).

Losses and costs associated with COVID-19  negatively hurt its commercial insurance and reinsurance underwriting  results; furthermore, future judicial rulings and regulatory and  legislative actions relating to insurance coverage and claims may affect  future results.

""Our underwriting results for the remainder of  2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for certain business may be adversely  affected from lower premiums attributable to credits granted to  policyholders and where premiums are a function of the insured’s  payroll,"" the company said in its 10-Q.

Operating earnings by segment:

* Insurance underwriting: loss of $213M vs. earnings of $440M a year ago.
* Insurance - investment income: $1.02B vs. $1.48B a year ago.
* Railroad, utilities and energy: $2.74B vs. $2.64B a year ago.
* Other businesses: $2.35B vs. $2.46B a year ago;
* Other: loss of $412M vs. earnings of $1.05B a year ago.

&#x200B;

Q3 net earnings of $30.1B vs. $26.3B in Q2 and  $16.5B a year ago; investment gains fell to $24.8B vs. $31.0B in Q2 and  rose from $8.7B a year ago.

Insurance float was \~$135B at Sept. 30, 2020, vs. \~$131B at June 30, 2020.

[ The company had \~$145.7B of cash, equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30](https://berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/3rdqtr20.pdf?source=news_body_link), 2020, just under the $146.6B it had at June 30.

About 70% of Berkshire's  investments in equities securities' aggregate fair value at Sept. 30  was concentrated in four companies with Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=news_body_link)) by far the biggest, at $111.7B. The others are Bank of America (NYSE:[BAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC?source=news_body_link)) at $24.9B, Coca-Cola (NYSE:[KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO?source=news_body_link)) at $19.7B, and American Express (NYSE:[AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP?source=news_body_link)) at $15.2B.

At Dec. 31, 2019, its investments in those four  companies represented 60% of aggregate fair value — $73.7B for AAPL,  $33.4B for BAC, $22.1B for KO and $18.9B for AXP.

Digging further down into Berkshire's 10-Q filing  and the company's unit results, its railroad, BNSF saw earnings before  income taxes slip to $1.78B vs. $1.94B in Q3 2019, primarily due to  lower volumes because of the pandemic.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy's earnings before income taxes increased to $1.12B from $1.06B a year earlier.

Manufacturing earnings before income taxes fell to  $2.26B from $2.48B, and service and retailing earnings before income  tax increased to $779M from $639M.

McLane Company saw earnings before income taxes nearly double Y/Y to $96M from $50M.

AAPL,PLTR to the 🌙 🚀 add more Calls 🔥,1606269500.0,"To the fuxking 🌙 Boissss 🚀 this badboy might even take us to marz before elon does. New highs every day! This is free money asking to be taken. 

Since its release nothing but good shit! Lets see what direction it takes us !

Big-data mining company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has an element of mystery or secrecy surrounding it. Perhaps that’s because Palantir has had clients like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense. 
And so, there’s something exciting about owning PLTR stock.
From what we know about Palantir, serving government agencies has been a highly lucrative niche. For instance, Palantir reportedly netted a contract earlier this year to provide software to the Department of Defense. Evidently, that contract was worth as much as $823 million.

AAPL,Just a friendly reminder. For every PUT and CALL you purchase. There is someone on the other end selling it to you,1604527164.0,
AAPL,Sell some fucking puts,1604346256.0,"I know you guys don't like to look at charts and trends, but do like to blindly follow randos on the internet. Luckily for you, I fucking love charts. So here's some plays that will make you money.

Sell some fucking put spreads. If the trade goes against you, roll it out. Roll it out and down even, meaning, widen the spread a little and use a lower strike for your short. Unless you're doing this with shit companies like Kodak, eventually you'll catch up to the stock and your put spread will expire worthless and you'll get full premium.

BA Nov 20 -140/135p for 1.4 credit. It's near the lower Bollinger band right now, meaning that only \~2% of the time is the stock ever that low. Take advantage of regression to the mean.

Right now Boeing (BA) is stupid low. But they have solid fundamentals and they have huge gov contracts and basically a fucking monopoly on airplanes in the US.

HUM 11/6 -380/375p for .8 credit. They haven't hit 380 since June. They have ER tomorrow so high IV = high premiums

W 11/6 -240/235. They're also at the lower band and they have ER. If the company is solid, it won't stay at the lower band for long.

AAPL 11/13 -105/100p AAPL doesn't hit 105 very often and when it does, it doesn't stay there. Their ER wasn't amazing, but that's because people were waiting to buy the 5g iPhones. If you wanna go further out, sell AAPL puts for January to capture the next ER that will reflect the new iPhone sales.

FSLY. They're down because of TikTok news and poor guidance last ER. If Trump shits the bed tomorrow, they'll fly. Nov 20 -65/60 puts

FUCKING TDOC. They're telemedicine and it's a pandemic. I'm a health care professional, they're a solid company, but are down a lot right now. They just acquired another health company. They beat ER but still dropped, so get in because they're outside of the lower band and oversold and won't stay below 200 for long.

Actually, if you do only one trade from here, TDOC -185/180 puts for 11/13 or literally any date because it's a pandemic and we're only going to use them more than ever this year.

Stop buying OTM puts and calls and hoping for a miracle. Sell some put spreads on companies you like and don't go all-in on one. You can choose not the be retarded and take advantage of this insane volatility."

Edit for Positions:

Mostly SPY, QQQ, AAPL, ROKU, BA, and DKNG"
AAPL,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why,1605176800.0," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say."
AAPL,Buffet and Papa Musk anime crossover?,1605715411.0,"~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)

Based on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. 

This is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.
@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.

According to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.

The BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.

Indeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:

Q2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B
Q1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B
Q4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B

So the current $16.5B difference is not normal.
The BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.

Assuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?

Another important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm

Furthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:

1) $AAPL
2) $AMZN
3) $BRK
4) $V
5) $JNJ
6) $JPM
7) $PG
8) $MA
9) $BAC
10) $KO

There are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ

None of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.

If it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...
25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:

https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html

So did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months."

AAPL,Apple M1 chip long term prospects to growth,1605851027.0,"FOR\* growth

Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.

&#x200B;

Tech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.

Seriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling.

&#x200B;

The M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).

&#x200B;

Could licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.

&#x200B;

Just some anecdotal tweets I read

&#x200B;

Seriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.

Now in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time?

&#x200B;

Also where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.

Gross Profit – Gross profit for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $7.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 14.2%, from $6.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross profit margin was 14.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019, an increase from the 12.8% gross profit margin for the year ended December 29, 2018. Gross profit in the Automation segment increased $2.4 million, or 60.3%, to $6.3 million for a gross profit margin of 17.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $3.9 million with a gross profit margin of 13.1% for the year ended December 29, 2018. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased utilization of personnel.

Revenue – Overall, our revenue for the year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 29, 2018, increased $2.5 million, or 4.5%, to $56.5 million from $54.0 million. Revenue from the Automation segment increased $7.2 million, or 24.0%, to $37.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $29.8 million for the comparable period in 2018. Revenue from the EPCM segment decreased $4.7 million, or 19.5%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $24.1 million for the comparable period in 2018. Our 2019 revenue for the EPCM segment continued to be negatively impacted by the sustained reduction in oil and gas prices and the resulting drop in our clients’ activities in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry. The Automation segment benefited from a significant downstream project awarded in 2019 for the production of clean fuels as required under new international standards in the maritime fuel sector.

Thats right it actually made a profit of 7.9m. With a market cap of 79million, that makes a profit to company valuation ratio of 1:10

compare that to AAPL with a net profit of 57.4 billion and market cap of 1.96 trillion making a profit to market cap ratio of 1:34

according to that the stock should go up 300% more."

AAPL,Apple's M1 chip is a bigger deal than you think.,1605313494.0,"It makes all of apples laptop lineup more powerful than any current gaming laptop. The unified memory is a huge deal that NVIDIA nor Intel can compete with as they offer external chips. The unified memory is what helps Playstation, XBox so powerful - custom built machines, and which Apple is now doing and PC's will never be able to do.

Apple will boost the power on these chips or an upgraded version and put them in their Mac Pro and iMac.  They will become the most powerful desktops available anywhere.

And they improve every year. Nobody will keep up with them. M2, M3.. they are faster than intel at advancing their CPU tech by leaps.

Now the move for most to MacOS from PC is.. difficult and it's hardly going to happen quickly. Gamers HATE apple desktops. But this gap in speed is going to become tremendous, and too much to ignore. People *will* convert. I imagine Apple's GPU will exceed NVIDIA in time. With the unified memory and on chip - GG.

Apple is going to become the premier laptop/desktop company of the world.

This is bad news for Intel, Microsoft, AMD, *and* NVIDIA. Apple is going to dominate with these processors.  This is basically a groundbreaking innovation that nobody seems to care about, and even scoff at, but it's coming. This is huge.

AAPL,An autist's guide to debit spreads,1604102959.0,"Debit spreads - how to officially hold option contracts with diamond hands until expiration, without fearing theta decay ruining your profits. The WSB degenerates’ guide of turning from a retard to an autist.

The Basics:

You can trade call debit spreads if you're bullish and put debit spreads if you're bearish. Furthermore, you can trade vertical spreads (equidistant strike prices) which are more conservative, or buy contracts closer ATM or even OTM while selling further OTM which are riskier but more rewarding.

Oftentimes traders buy one ITM and sell (short) one OTM. The reason why most people who trade debit spreads do this is because buying a contract ITM means you automatically have intrinsic value and so if the price stays the same your contract will still be worth money by expiration.

If you want to trade debit spreads the safest way, then trade vertical debit spreads where the strike prices are equidistant from the current stock price. For example, if Apple’s share price was $100 I would buy a contract $10 ITM and sell another $10 contract OTM to get a vertical debit spread. However, if you're more risk-tolerant, you can try to have the contract you buy closer ATM or even OTM. This is riskier but provides a higher reward than standard vertical debit spreads.

From the research conducted here are the conclusions. If you’re an aggressive trader but unsure of the direction of the stock price trade tight vertical spreads and adjust the expiration date according to how fast you believe the stock can move into your favor, preferably 1-3 weeks. If you’re an aggressive trader and are certain that the stock will move in your direction then buy at a strike price ATM (technically slightly OTM) and short a contract far OTM to a price you think it can hit by expiration, the expiration date should preferably be 2-5 weeks. If you’re a conservative trader then don’t trade options. Seriously, please don’t. However, If you are a conservative trader but still want to experiment with options then trade with wide vertical spreads and have an expiration far out, preferably 5 weeks or more as it will give you more time for the price to move into your favor.

Now hold those contracts until expiration with those diamond hands, don’t let your dreams go to waste, anybody can do this all you gotta do is believe in yourself. Don’t let no motherfucker put you down, you little bitch stop whining about this stuff. That’s right, now go out there and win yourself some tendies.

AAPL,Investing Strategies - Dividend Growth Investing - Advantages/Disadvantages + Breakdown,1604257700.0,"# Introduction

Hello guys, this will be a breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is ofcourse an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a high dividend yield, is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal a dividend cut or the elimination of the dividend. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is sightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can hugely decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, there have been many quality companies that have still increased their payouts during this time.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them. Growth stocks typically don’t pay out so there’s no forced withdrawal, so you don’t get hit with taxes, however the trade off is you are now reliant on the appreciation of the stock.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.

# Advantages:

* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Types of Companies to invest into:

Below will be a list of Dividend paying companies that have **increased their dividends yearly**. Often when you are researching these companies you will see them thrown into these categories based on how often they have increased their dividends:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

And now the companies (only a few common examples, there are way too many to list):

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger
* VZ - Verizon - Contender
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King
* MMM - 3M - King
* T - AT&T - Champion
* KO - Coca-Cola - King

And so on, many of these companies are ones we all recognize because they are so well established have have very wide markets. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, often having enough money to expand into new markets by buying up new companies or just allocating free capital to the sectors.

# How to evaluate the companies for this strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Payout less than 50% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable
   * The company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!
* **High dividend yield are not the focus and can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)**

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola $ Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income.

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies. Each different type of investor can learn from the other, dividend vs index vs growth or otherwise. Anyways, have a good day everyone!

Well here we are again. It's a total gaslight fuckathon that is making people similarly question their own  sanity.

This time is requires one to believe in systematic voter fraud, govt/media/social media corruption, censorship, psychological manipulation, and the widely unpopular, conspiracy theorist view that Orange will emerge victorious over Sleepy Joe. Make no mistake about it, if there is a Big Short sequel it will be about the autists who made a fortune bc they were right when everyone else was wrong.

AAPL,[SYNA] Earnings Play - Synaptics (They report Nov 5th),1603981625.0,"Listen up, autists. If you are looking for the next great semiconductor/IoT play, look no further. Get yourselves familiar with a messiah named Michael Hurlston and his ark named Synaptics. Let him take you to the promised land.

1) What is Synaptics?

For almost 35 years, Synaptics has been focused on how people interact with devices. The company has created technology for touchscreens, touchpads, and fingerprint readers, and in recent years has focused on displays and touchscreens used in mobile phones. Synaptics makes parts used in Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Google Home speakers, and automotive touchscreens, among other applications.

Synaptics’ fortunes flagged in recent years, hurt by a drifting corporate mission and growing competition from Asia. Revenue in the June 2020 fiscal year was $1.33 billion, about 10% below the year-earlier level, marking the third straight year of declining revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $5.95 a share, up from $4 in fiscal 2019, reversing four consecutive years of declining profits.


2) Who is Michael Hurlston?

This savior became SYNA’s CEO about a year ago. When Michael Hurlston became CEO of Synaptics a year ago, the chip seller was a “bag of parts,” he says. “Job No. 1 was to make the most out of each part of the portfolio.”

Hurlston, 53, has done that, and more, chopping costs, shedding weak operations, making smart acquisitions, and burnishing the financial outlook of the San Jose, Calif.–based company, which makes components used in human-machine interface applications. So far, investors like what they see: Synaptics’ stock has rallied almost 150% in the past 12 months, reversing the prior four years’ losses. More gains could lie ahead, as Hurlston and his team continue to restructure and grow the business.

Hurlston seems a good choice to move things forward. Most recently he was CEO of Finisar, an optical-networking component company that he sold to II-VI for $3.2 billion within a year of his arrival. Before that, he was senior vice president for mobile, wireless, and connectivity products at Broadcom. More on that in a moment.

“When I arrived here, the company was undermanaged,” Hurlston said in a Zoom interview from his office. “There just wasn’t a lot of rigor around anything we did—no regular engineering reviews, or budget reviews, or general tracking of progress.”

Hurlston restructured the product portfolio, selling a business that makes integrated touch and display chips for LCD phones to a Chinese private-equity firm. Most high-end phones now use OLED displays, with LCDs used primarily in lower-end devices, he noted. Competition was fierce, and margins were ebbing.

Two acquisitions then followed, both closing in July. Synaptics bought DisplayLink, a Palo Alto–based company with a lock on the market for components used in universal docking stations, for $305 million in cash. “They’re the only company that has been able to figure this out,” Hurlston said.

The transaction was immediately accretive to earnings.

Synaptics also spent $250 million for Broadcom’s wireless Internet of Things business, which includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS technologies. Hurlston knew that business intimately: He used to run it. “We felt like there were a lot of places where we needed wireless assets,” he said, citing video and audio products and wireless docking stations. “It’s a deal that only we could have done. My old team was involved, and some of them came over here.”

He sees applications in wearables, surveillance cameras, and video set-top boxes.


3) Valuation?

At a recent $78~/share, Synaptics trades for just over two times estimated revenue and less than 13 times expected profit for the June-2021 fiscal year. Competitors, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and Microchip Technology (MC HP ), fetch five to 10 times current-year revenue, suggesting Synaptics is underappreciated in every sense of the word.

Furthermore, when SYNA beat their numbers in the last earnings call (and raised Q1 guidance), the stock jumped significantly and briefly touched 52 week high ($90~/share) before the stock retreated along with the market over the last 3 months. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about this company’s future prospects. They purchased IoT portfolio from Broadcom (AVGO) and they are focusing on high margin segments and once again, this stock is ripe for another beat when they report on Nov 5th. It is not out of the question that the stock will continue to march over the next 12 months and if you missed out on AMD/NVDA and other semiconductor play, this is the stock that you have been looking for.

Lastly, per Michael Hurlston who has a track record of turning around companies like Finisar, Synaptics had become a “$1 billion revenue company in the body of a $2 billion revenue company,” with an inefficient structure. For example, its PC business had a core design center in Taiwan’s capital city of Taipei, and offices in Armenia; Hyderabad, India; and the U.S. He closed all but the Taipei office, located near PC design operations for customers HP Inc. and Dell. “I did that kind of thing across the business,” he said. The result: Quarterly operating expenses fell to about $80 million from $110 million, and head count dropped to 1,200 from 1,700.

Meanwhile, Synaptics’ gross profit margins have risen in the past year to nearly 50% from under 40%. The company is configured, he says, to grow revenue in the 4% to 6% range, with profits rising faster as margins expand. Analysts expect Synaptics to earn $6.49 a share this year on revenue of $1.3 billion. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh thinks that earnings could top $8 a share in fiscal 2022. The stock “looks inexpensive with multiple ways to outperform,” he recently wrote.

4) Street Coverage

Paul Wick, a portfolio manager with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, owns more than 10% of Synaptics’ shares in the Columbia Seligman Communications & Information fund (SLMCX), which he has run for more than 30 years. He’s a big Hurlston fan, and has been impressed with the new focus on growth and operating efficiency. Wick recalls how Hurlston was astonished by the huge number of fabs and test and assembly houses Synaptics was using. “They weren’t getting volume discounts from anyone,” Wick says. “They were able to reduce the number of vendors and get better pricing.”

MSFT,"I have AMZN, FB, and MSFT - I want to drop one and consolidate my positions into two. Which would you choose?",1604801203.0,"The case for AMZN - it can grow in so many directions and has surprised us time and time again.

The case for FB - leader in social networking. sure, they've maxed out on users, but they are opening other revenue streams with instagram.

The case for MSFT - just a steady beast. growth is not that sexy and has been a lame duck in my portfolio. Sure, Azure is hot, but it's competing with AWS, so I feel there's some duplication here. 

Honestly, I'm leaning towards dropping MSFT - getting greedy. The other side of me wants to keep MSFT because it's the ""safest"" out of the three.

Thoughts?

edit: My goal is to further consolidate my positions to accelerate growth. I have other positions but now evaluating these 3 at the moment."

MSFT,Microsoft beats on sales and earnings as Azure growth outpaces expectations,1603833310.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q1-2021.html

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $1.82 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.54 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $37.15 billion, vs. $35.72 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Microsoft revenue grew 12% on an annualized basis, down from 13% growth in the prior quarter, according to a statement. 

Revenue for commercial PCs cratered 22% months after support for Windows 7 ended and the coronavirus pandemic took hold; the category had surged last year, making outperformance this year more difficult.

But one of the fastest-growing parts of Microsoft, the Azure public cloud for hosting applications and websites, grew 48%, accelerating from 47% in the prior quarter. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from Azure in dollars. Analysts had expected around 44% growth."

MSFT,"How high can PLTR go? Or put more succinctly, how big is the market that PLTR is playing in?",1605409202.0,"I bought PLTR at around $10 seeing some momentum in that stock and already gained around 50%.

When I bought it I just saw that it provides software for governments and allows patterns within datasets etc.

Basically I have read some articles and understood horse shit. Big data??

I have seen that they have made a contract with an oil company which will help that oil company save around $1B.

I know that PLTR is being extensively supported by the US govt and they won't enter the Chinese market, which means this company is never going bankrupt.

And knowing Peter Thiel, this could be something huge.

All I want to understand from you guys is how big a market PLTR is actually playing in? Which other companies do you think will eat PLTRs lunch(MSFT and AMZN seem very likely)?

And if PLTR actually manages to pull off its game, how could it be impacting our lives?

I kinda know what you guys will say, take profit and to never invest in something I don't understand, but please avoid this kinds of answers, because I know that.😅"

MSFT,The PLTR Weaponized autism reminds me of something...,1606031488.0,"Looking at all these fellow Icarus retards spewing PLTR to the moon  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  and PLTR rIsK FrEe gUaRaNtEeD I'd like to give all the new meat some history...

Mr. SEC, if you're reading this, this has nothing to do with the W E A P O N I Z E D A U T I S M^((TM)) where a million RH accounts with a million retards all dogpile into a few concentrated OTM positions (lol what is ITM?) forcing dealers to increasingly delta hedge their positions by buying the underlying stock. More demand in the stock (no matter how deep it is, but it often works better if it's lightly floated). This also has nothing to do with how PLTR, a relatively recent IPO, probably doesn't have that many option writers which results in a possible spike in demand for calls which not enough supply, forcing market makers to both write more calls and buy more underlying.

Case in point: MSFT during Jan/Feb 2020, QQQ during July/August, TSLA at random months throughout 2019 and 2020, and random Chinese EVs in October/Nov.

IV for PLTR 1mo 15% OTM is around 70%. That's not that high... MSFT and QQQ 1mo 15% OTM during their respective ""high demand periods"" had IVs near 25-35%. TSLA 1mo 15% OTM (which has always been high) was around 100% during the pre-split run, which ran up to around 180% at the end of the run.

TLDR: Buy PLTR calls (PLTR $25c Jan 2021). PLTR next meme stock confirmed. It only works if everyone believes. Also because PLTR knows everything, it probably pre-cog'd you already by buying calls for itself.

MSFT,GME - Let the games begin,1605075807.0,"I just wanna start off by saying, it's no coincidence that this news came yesterday - on CONSOLE RELEASE DAY which **also** happens to be the day when short interest data was to be released. That's what you call execution **chef kiss*.*

Yes, this is only the beginning. The console cycle has just begun and GameStop is the largest retailer of games and consoles in the world, with over **5,500** stores worldwide in 14 countries [1]. This cycle will last (at least 5) years, as all have previously. GME's pivot to e-commerce combined with an entry into the gaming equipment market will be the defining edge for GameStop.

GameStop. The only place you *know* will have whatever gaming-related item you want - with same day delivery in many locations. This is where GameStop is headed. 

Most of you will already have heard the news from GameStop regarding ""Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes"" [2]. For anyone that's unsure, this means that they are repaying debts equivalent to $125mn *voluntarily*; as in they are not *required* to pay that debt back right now. 

We already knew that GameStop reported $700mn+ in cash so this reaffirms that GameStop are able to use the cash for deleveraging as opposed to them being *in a tight spot for cash*, so to speak, during the pandemic. This is great news for a brick-and-mortar store (since half of Reddit wants to keep calling it that) considering the sheer number of funds that are about to flow through GameStop (as they have been on pre-orders and will continue for YEARS). I'm no longer concerned about the next earnings as the cost-cutting by Management has been ridiculous. GameStop WILL beat ER expectations.

The news of a vaccine does not negatively impact GameStop or GME stock, in my opinion. People aren't going to game any less than they were before lockdowns, simply because lockdowns are (allegedly) going to go away soon. Before covid was a thing, the gaming industry was continuing to explode as it as has been year on year. It's not gonna slow down any time soon. Not now. Not when Sony and Microsoft just blessed us with the next generation of gaming consoles.

Also, short interest is down this time around but only by around 4 million shares. We still have about 66 million shares short. Any more big news and we'll be off 🚀🌚.

To recap: 

-Burry/Cohen still **in**


-u/DeepFuckingValue still *IN* (big respects for 💎 hands)


-institutions increasing their stakes in GME [3]


-short interest still over 100% (insane, in itself. However, combined with the increase in institutional ownership, this adds to the ""battle for GME"" lore. Meme status increased⬆️)


-new console cycle JUST started and it's going to last YEARS
(GameStop bout to make bank and keep making bank)


-debts have been reduced by $125mn


-costs being reassessed and cut down regularly

-stores with negative cash flow being shut down continually


-MSFT deal


-yada yada yada

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jjuo14/gmebout_to_see_history_repeat_itself/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

**TL;DR** If you *still* think GameStop is going bust, idk for you fam. Quit while (you think) you're ahead. It may squeeze, it may not. But if you don't think it's gonna moon, think again.

I wonder how many times I said GameStop in this post.

I guess I spend too much time on this sub). Also made a post on ENPH but I think it was removed. Anyways...

If you want a virgin ripe-for-taking play this week for earnings, i suggest you take a look into Rackspace. Here's my depiction:

&#x200B;

***What the fuck is Rackspace?***

* Rackspace is a cloud services provider that helps companies port data to Amazon Web Services, and also provides infrastructure management and managed application services.
* Rackspace helps Amazon  and Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, among others to move data around.[1](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)
* Rackspace was once a public company in 2008, but went private in 2016. They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&qs=n&sp=-1&pq=rackspace+ipo&sc=8-13&sk=&cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&first=7&FORM=PORE)
   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)

&#x200B;

***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***

* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began
   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.
* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.
   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***

Debt. [3.9 billion to be exact](https://www.thestreet.com/ipo/news/rackspace-technology-ipo-launch#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202020%2C%20Rackspace%20had%20%24125,flow%20during%20the%20twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2031%2C). yes, this is a lot. however, during the last ER, the CEO and CFO reiterated intentions to reducing this debt. i believe it is the ony reason this stock hasn't mooned like DDOG. with customers like amazon, microsoft, google, among others, i believe this company posts record revenue, as have many other cloud companies, and decreases debt substantially. This is a rocket ship folks.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12/18 17.5C  


  


EDIT: The stock took a dip after ER because Benzinga and seeking alpha scraped the 2019 3rd quarter results from the release. RXT beat EPS, revenue, and reduced debt. once people and the bots learn to read this will go higher. Listen to the earnings call at 5."
MSFT,PALANTIR ----> $ 1000 PER SHARE,1606235306.0,A very undervalued stock. Buy at much as you can. It WILL POP.
MSFT,"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",1605246827.0,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Estée Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company’s CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company’s gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it’s never your fault. It’s the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic."

MSFT,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why,1605176800.0," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say."

good idea?"
MSFT,Nintendo(TYO 7974) Analysis,1604771215.0,"Nintendo, I think is the best gaming stock to buy. My partial reasonings:

* Gaming is all about IP. And Nintendo has the most recognisable IP. Mario, Pokemon(part ownership), Zelda etc have the brand recognition that few other games have.
* Pricing power. Nintendo can sell a game without giving any discounts and people will buy it. Case in point, Nintendo released its latest Super Mario 3d All-Stars games at $60, which are just 3 fairly simple ports. Yet, [they sold 5.21M copies within 12 days(at page 10).](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/201105_4e.pdf) Because of its IP strength, they are also able to sell older Wii-U ports at full price. Their titles also don't get much discounted. No other gaming company boast such pricing power among its player base. This is one of the reason there Operating Profits jumped 209% till September(click the first link).
* Lower development cost. Nintendo game philosophy is centred around the concept of ""fun"". So, unlike developers like Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda(parent acquired by MSFT), Rockstar, Activision Blizzard etc, they follow a unique strategy in developing games which results in a much lower development cost compared to their peers. Nintendo's gaming base(which includes hyper fans to children) is also supportive of its efforts. This has two-way benefits for Nintendo compared to its peers.
   * Development costs of games are skyrocketing and at this rate, these companies will slowly have more difficulty in recouping costs.
   * Nintendo's development cost, while not known per games is hypothesized to be lower. This means Nintendo finds it much easier to recoup costs.
* Other game companies in different stock exchanges worldwide have much higher multiples of valuations. Nintendo, who is expected to have higher growth(for the next 4 years) than most of the developers I have searched for, is relatively cheaply valued. [Simple Valuation Comparison.](https://imgur.com/gallery/j2EqHcx)
* Nintendo has more than adequate cash buffer. It is [currently the most cash-rich company in Japan.](https://news.livedoor.com/lite/article_detail/18788644/) Given Nintendo's experimental strategies, this ensures that Nintendo is extremely unlikely to face any liquidity crisis.
* Nintendo is also a platform holder. Which means it stands to profit from every game sold by other developers in its platform and its own games have a higher margin. This also allowed it to launch Switch Online subscription service, which while cheap, could provide a hefty return, especially in the upcoming few years. Also, unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo actually makes money from the beginning while selling each console.
* Future plans(rumour based)
   * Nintendo is expected to release a pro version of Switch(or just upgrade the Switch internals) which would boost Switch sales(management already upgraded forecast today by 20%).
   * Nintendo management didn't shy away from the possibility of launching other forms of online gaming service. They are experimenting with game streaming. Control: Ultimate Edition is already available to stream in Nintendo Switch.
   * Many others not mentioned here for brevity's sake.
* Growing diversified revenue source.
   * Their merchandising business is going to grow along with its gaming revenues.
   * Unique products like the Mario Kart: Home Circuit, Amiibos(which are a combined form of merchandise and in-app purchase), Nintendo Labo etc points to a company that has managed to integrate the physical and virtual world very competently. These products while a small part of its revenue equation would likely keep on growing.
   * Their cinema ventures(an upcoming movie in partnership with Illumination) could grow further. Management has stated that they are likely to invest in these ventures more based on their success. This may result in TV shows and similar products getting released more. It must be mentioned though, Nintendo generally uses partnerships to venture into these markets and doesn't directly release the products, which means they get a small portion of the overall revenue.
   * Theme park partnership with Universal.
* Upcoming titles could add significant profit potentials for Nintendo. Although we don't exactly know what they will be, management has already stated that they have merged their development efforts(before it was split among Wii-U and 3ds) which would lead to higher outputs.
   * One of the disappointments is that Nintendo still seems to have not poured enough resources into its mobile gaming efforts and seems like we wouldn't get any revolutionary products like Pokemon Go. However, Nintendo published games in the Switch have very high attachment rates which somewhat counters the lack of games on mobile.
   * As an example, let's compare Super Mario Odyssey against Witcher 3. Witcher 3(an extremely popular game and released a movie), which released in 2015 and is available in many platforms sold around 50M(as of May) copies. The base price of the game has been much lower than the $60 price Nintendo requires. Yet, Super Mario Odyssey sold around 19M copies being in a single platform. This, by no means, is an apple to an orange scenario. But I presented this example to illustrate the next point I am coming to and to make you aware of the strength of the Switch platform.
* Brand loyalty. Nintendo fans are very brand loyal because of the unique market approach of Nintendo. While other publishers are constantly barraged with gamer complaints and vocal minorities, Nintendo, while keeping its fans loyal, managed to shield itself from much of the disdain some gamers have towards other publishers. EA, Activision Blizzard, Epic, Ubisoft(even CD Projekt Red) etc seems to be constantly bamboozled by their vocal minority fans. As a result, the sense of community and brand loyalty is missing. Nintendo tends to do exceptionally well in this regard which is necessary for sustainable game sales. This also somewhat explains the exceptional attachment rates, pricing power etc. Its various games' fanbase also has a reputation of being helpful and welcoming, lacking the toxicity(Smash is an exception) of other gaming communities.
* Competent management. This is the name of the game. While other studios constantly seem to be in the need to change in management, developer exits etc. Current Nintendo management has proved itself to be worthy. 
* ARKK contains NTDOY as a holdings.

Risks:

* Nintendo has a habit of creating extremely profitable products and then suddenly getting derailed. However, for the next 4 years, this sort of mishap is unlikely to happen.
* Sony and Microsoft are going to release their next-generation consoles. Although, this is unlikely to dent sales(because of Nintendo's blue ocean strategy) as management didn't really imply that it would happen; instead they chose to upgrade the sales forecast.

Final commentary:

Gaming has entered a mega-trend territory. I think Nintendo is best positioned to capture this mega-trend as they have all the ingredients of success. Plus, Nintendo being undervalued compared to its peers make it a good opportunity to ride this trend.

Gaming is ultimately a risky business and no other publisher(other than MSFT, which already is valued to the teeth) is as well positioned in this market as Nintendo.

TL;DR: I think Nintendo is the best stock for the next 3-4 years among other gaming stocks.

Have a good day! :-)

MSFT,Investing Strategies - Dividend Growth Investing - Advantages/Disadvantages + Breakdown,1604257700.0,"# Introduction

Hello guys, this will be a breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is ofcourse an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a high dividend yield, is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal a dividend cut or the elimination of the dividend. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is sightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can hugely decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, there have been many quality companies that have still increased their payouts during this time.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them. Growth stocks typically don’t pay out so there’s no forced withdrawal, so you don’t get hit with taxes, however the trade off is you are now reliant on the appreciation of the stock.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.

# Advantages:

* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Types of Companies to invest into:

Below will be a list of Dividend paying companies that have **increased their dividends yearly**. Often when you are researching these companies you will see them thrown into these categories based on how often they have increased their dividends:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

And now the companies (only a few common examples, there are way too many to list):

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger
* VZ - Verizon - Contender
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King
* MMM - 3M - King
* T - AT&T - Champion
* KO - Coca-Cola - King

And so on, many of these companies are ones we all recognize because they are so well established have have very wide markets. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, often having enough money to expand into new markets by buying up new companies or just allocating free capital to the sectors.

# How to evaluate the companies for this strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Payout less than 50% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable
   * The company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!
* **High dividend yield are not the focus and can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)**

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola $ Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income.

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies. Each different type of investor can learn from the other, dividend vs index vs growth or otherwise. Anyways, have a good day everyone!

MSFT,Amateur Crayons on SPY,1604257276.0,"Alright fellow Autists, here's my take on the SPY going into this volatile ass week.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vn5m0tuibow51.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=423e991494a88117fd68fe8d1f63ceb9b6847957

 First things first, we have the daily chart on the SPY going back to around July in this. The red line is a basic support line I drew, notice how it was briefly touched Friday as the LOD. On 9/24 this was briefly undercut as well, opening below it but recovering and proceeding to gap fill. The rally on volume Friday may suggest there are plenty of buyers ready to step in and may round out the second bottom needed for a bullish double bottom.

Pulling back a bit longer out, the support resistance trend line has several interesting spots on it to back up the strength of roughly 322.50 floor. Starting from the left, we see the first arrow indicating the start of a floor, as spy had a little consolidation. The second arrow indicates the floor that was obliterated and signaled our descent into a free fall of fuckery on that fateful February/March bear market. You'll notice that even though there was an enormous gap down, the support line was unbroken that day. Yes I realize it was broken the very next day but the support line is undeniable. The third arrow points to what was the floor becoming resistance, after nearly recovering from the massive sell off. SPY consolidated a little and went right back up through the resistance as indicated by the 4th arrow, eventually becoming a support point before the next gap up. Monday will be a very telling day indeed. If we go much farther past down 319/318.5 without any buyers stepping in I think that will start the downward trend.

AMZN,EU files antitrust against AMZN,1605009832.0,"https://apnews.com/article/international-news-europe-8e0222555df76c36bfbeed3289222d94



I buy several times a week from them but I'm the biggest enemy of Amazon Choice and Best Seller .
I used to sort by reviews/stars but now sends you to unrelated items. Even though many fake reviews. 

LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators have filed antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using data to gain an unfair advantage over merchants using its platform.
The EU's executive commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday that the charges have been sent to the company.
The commission said it takes issue with Amazon's systematic use of non-public business data to avoid “the normal risks of competition and to leverage its dominance"" for e-commerce services in France and Germany, the company's two biggest markets in the EU.
The EU started looking into Amazon in 2018 and has been focusing on its dual role as a marketplace and retailer.

In addition to selling its own products, the U.S. company allows third-party retailers to sell their own goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.
Amazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.
“We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,” the company said in a statement.
The company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.
It’s the EU’s latest effort to curb the power of big technology companies, following a series of multibillion dollar antitrust fines against Google in previous years."

Honestly, I'm leaning towards dropping MSFT - getting greedy. The other side of me wants to keep MSFT because it's the ""safest"" out of the three.

Basically everyone thought Africa was dead money and JMIA was doomed because of shitty infrastructure and logistics. So JMIA said fuck it we gotta do it ourselves then, and...they did. Now they're opening it up to third party sellers. They literally just went out and did it and are now letting everyone else use it.

**""It's a move that sees Jumia instantly become one of the biggest players in e-commerce logistics space across the continent.""**

**""But Jumia's obvious gain's aside, the move is also potentially crucial for the wider e-commerce sector given how much of an albatross efficient logistics has been for businesses looking to widen their scope through online commerce and delivery.""**

&#x200B;

they literally built it, have been testing it, and are rolling it out. they're even offering first 10 free deliveries to entice businesses to give it a shot and see for themselves.

&#x200B;

Not to mention their payments arm, Jumia Pay, just saw their payments volume double YoY to $63mm and 2.4 million transactions -- **which has not yet been monetized**.

&#x200B;

Ask 10 of your trader/investor dipshit friends if they know any of this about JMIA. their uninformed responses are representative of what the market and the idiot shorts who are gonna get toasted believe, and this is why they are wrong.

EDIT: watch their next 4 quarters closely for growth in this new logistics space they've carved out. if it proves painless and effective, bulls get rewarded handsomely. and the next domino right behind it is Jumia Pay

EDIT 3: a common criticism i've seen is that the people running the company aren't african and therefore aren't qualified or somehow don't know shit. i'm convinced the two frenchies operating as co-CEOs are absolutely 100% all in on Africa, because it's the only uncharted ecommerce territory in the world. every other stake has been claimed elsewhere. these french fries are going for bezos status

AMZN,Reassessing $amzn and if it's a buy/hold at over $3000,1605457485.0,"I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.

I took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.

This is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:

1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 ""Bar Raisers"" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they ""Raise the Bar"" with each hire. 

2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. 

3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. 

4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.

Anyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?

Are you invested in $amzn and if so, what are your top reasons or Amazon businesses for continuing to hold or buy even more? Or alternatively, if you're not investing in $amzn why not? 

Will be interesting to get some varied perspectives, as Amazon is such a beast and a nevereneding topic."

The retailer’s sales totaled $22.3 billion in the three months ended Oct. 31, a $3.9 billion increase from the same period last year. By comparison, the chain’s increase in sales for the entire preceding fiscal year was $2.7 billion. In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter. It’s an utterly herculean operational lift — requiring a rethinking of supply chain, inventory management and labor models — and it bodes well for Target’s long-term prospects that it was able to adapt to these conditions so quickly.""

AMZN,"Amazon beats, Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 expected, Revenue: $96.15b vs $92.7b expected",1604002604.0,"(CNBC) Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

More fair comparison would be Rivian (similar financial backing plus enterprise deal with AMZN, F is a backer), with working prototypes and Q3 2021 delivery dates. Rivian had an $8 billion valuation as of July's funding round.

AMZN,71k YOLO $BABA 290c 02/19/21,1605409719.0,"I was planning to wait a bit longer before entry, but I just couldn't resist as I witnessed some weird option price movements near the closing bell on Friday and honestly, $BABA is a steal at the current prices.

I'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% drop). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?

1. Alibaba holds a \~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the possible increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.
2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market.

However, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.

&#x200B;

While $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.

[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)

Guys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate.

Some more info about BABA for you value investors out there:

BABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC

AMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC

JD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC

BABA is incredibly underpriced.

Also, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.

The IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.

The fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.

Don't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.

AMZN,WSJ: A Stock Market Bubble? It’s More Like a Fire,1605889033.0,"I found today's Intelligent Investor column interesting - in regards to the recent surges in EV stocks, SPACs, etc.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stock-market-bubble-its-more-like-a-fire-11605888002?mod=hp\_lead\_pos12](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stock-market-bubble-its-more-like-a-fire-11605888002?mod=hp_lead_pos12)

 

The stock market isn’t a bubble, but parts of it are on fire.

So far in 2020, the NYSE FANG+ index of giant technology stocks is up 78%. The [Renaissance IPO ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO), [IPO **1.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO?mod=chiclets)an exchange-traded fund that holds recent public offerings, is up 84%. The [SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG), [CNRG **+1.35%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG?mod=chiclets)which invests in renewable-energy companies, has gained 88%.

Meanwhile, the overall stock market is up almost 11%.

That’s a key difference.

For years, anyone who thinks any financial asset is somewhat overvalued has called it a bubble. The financial use of “bubble” [originated centuries ago ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-TOTALB-501?mod=article_inline)to describe massive speculation that [inflates market prices to the bursting point](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-does-a-bubble-spell-trouble-1389399975?mod=article_inline).

Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are [diabolically difficult to identify](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204621904577017960729384948?mod=article_inline) without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.

The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.

Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after [the stock market crash of 1929](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline), or [Japan 60-plus years later](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/).

Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.

“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “[the fire triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle).” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.

The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.

On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B) Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.

The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.

Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.

The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.

That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But [hedge funds and other institutions](https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0) also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.

The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been [updated with a fourth component](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri), an “exothermic chain reaction.”

Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.

That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.

“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.

That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.

In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without [technology companies](http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf), the S&P 500 would have been up only 5%.

Today isn’t much different.

In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.

To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.

I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and [shell companies formed to do buyouts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline).

The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&P 500 also tumbled.

Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc. That might be the firebreak that this market needs."

* Sell call price is 6.2% of current share price.

What can we determine from this information:

|Company|Sell Call Price as % of Current Share Price|
:--|:--|
|NIO|5.3%|
|South West (LUV)|1.7%|
|Plug Power (PLUG)|6.2%|

Like can we say investors are 3-3.5x more excited about NIO and PLUG compared to LUV? Are NIO and PLUG similar in terms of their ability to reach the target call price? What insights can we extract here about how the market feels about the stock's prospect for the next 2 weeks?"

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

AMZN,$TGT - The Karen Play,1606238162.0,"I’ve posted about TGT before, since those posts (check my history if you want), we’ve seen sizable gains through and after earnings.  

Here’s what I know about Q4 - 

Target will continue to increase market cap, still under $90B, it remains one of the cheapest retailers in the S&P500.  

With partnerships across multiple entities, and a supply chain that’s best in class, I don’t see many reasons to dislike this stock.  To name a few - CVS, Ulta, Shipt, Overstock, Bed Bath and Beyond.  

Target is taking market share from all of their partners, it’s a natural cannibalizarion, and it will likely continue for some time.  

Target is taking market share from its competitors, mainly WMT and AMZN, as they succeed in the tech space, and the retail space.  

The main competitor which will hurt Target is Costco, which to me, feels like more of a threat to WMT, than TGT.  Why?  Karen.  

Karen loves Target.  There’s high enough margins on goods, that it keeps most of the poor people at WMT.  

Karen also likes Wholefoods, but she only shops there for special things.  She knows she can get a 10% discount for most of the name brands at Wholefoods vs Target.  

Karen has a RedCard.  The 5% she saves on all transactions, plus free shipping makes it a staple in her wallet.  

Karen uses the Target app or Shipt.  Maybe not as much as AMZN, but it’s on her Home Screen.  

Karen likes Target pickup.  During a pandemic, nothing is easier that getting your apples brought to your car.  

Karen has unlimited buying power, and is a customer who doesn’t often change shopping habits.  

Karen is going to buy a bunch of Christmas candles and nonsense decor, where do you think she’s going to purchase it?  

Karen likes that there’s a Starbucks in the store, it’s the main reason she came, but she’ll buy groceries for her kids while she’s here.  


Retards of WSB, my Karen thesis.  


Thus far, I’ve made $48k on target this year.

I also own 500 shares at a cost basis of $140s.

AMZN,"$SE: Short Vol, Long Delta - The Hummingbird Spread",1605386950.0,"$SE, or Sea Limited, is an internet and mobile platform company. The firm engages in the provision of online gaming services. It currently has platforms like Garena (gaming platform), Shopee (e-commerce), and SeaMoney (digital currency). Furthermore, this company is based in Singapore and has seen tremendous growth throughout the year. ADR/OTC products seems to have a bit of lag (for example, look at $TSLA and $NIO relationship) behind its industry counterparties. $SE may see growth like $AMZN and other tech companies, but in Singapore.

$SE is due to report earnings this Tuesday. The implied move of $SE is 15%, meaning people are expecting the stock to move from $180 to either $155 or $205. Historically, this has never happened before in an earnings. Current revenue/EPS projections do not justify such a movement, either.

$SE also has the most popular game in the world right now -  Free Fire. Want to know an interesting fact about fire? Fire is bad for hummingbirds, and has destroyed many of their homes. How can we use this information to generate alpha?

Here, the light gray area represents the movement of 1 STDEV (encompassing \~68% of the likely move). Taking the integral of this region (which is the expected value of the trade), we end up seeing a \~3.2% ROI. The only way we lose is if $SE absolutely tanks and crashes to the ground.

AMZN,IPOB (Opendoor) - Nameplate Institutions Piling In Ahead of Merger Expected in December,1605987969.0,"Some interesting developments on the institutional holdings front:

\- Ark Funds - up to 3MM shares. They continue to add at a 10K/share a day clip on average. Their biggest bet has been TSLA and known as one of the best performing technology funds out there

\- Suvretta Capital Management: 4.1MM shares. Run by a former SAC (Steve Cohen) investment professional who also worked at Soros Capital Management. Other big investments include ADBE, AMZN 

\- Soros Capital Management: now in for 1MM shares. A new position. Everyone knows who this guy is. 

\- FMR LLC - newly added about 800K shares. They are a little known money manager called Fidelity. As one of the biggest mutual fund/money managers in existence, this is huge. 

These four groups provide tremendous validation to IPOB/Opendoor - nameplate anchors in the equity (who collectively now own close to 25% of the float) who will help attract a ton of followership as this gets to merger. 

You can validate the data on your own looking at the institutional holdings tracked by Nasdaq or CapIQ. 

Don't think we've seen this before in any SPAC that has yet to merge, but I could be wrong!

AMZN,Puts on Nigerian Scam,1604522839.0,"Jumia (JMIA) is an African tech company which operates an e-commerce marketplace and an online payment platform. People have tried to frame it as “the next Amazon” or “the Amazon of Africa,” but this stock is the definition of a Nigerian scam. It has tanked since IPO due to continued losses and fraud allegations which it basically admitted were true, but is recently pumping again due to its earnings call upcoming on November 10th in a pattern that mirrors almost exactly what happened around its last earnings call in August 2020.

Here’s why it’s an easy short—

**A) Clear pattern of pump and dump before earnings along with a history of fraud**

Insane amounts of call buying from Robinhood idiots who think this company is African Amazon pumped this stock up > $20/sh before the last earnings report, and that pattern is repeating today, with the stock up 120% since October 1. Last I checked, the put/call ratio was like .5 or something, which is insane. Last time, a horrible earnings report crushed the stock, taking away all of the gains from the runup, and this is likely to happen again for reasons I will continue to detail below.

(This is a bit autistic because TA/chart reading is bullshit, but the picture so far is copying exactly what happened last time-- huge spike, starts to dump, dead cat bounce that doesnt quite reach full peak (this is where we are), massive dump during earnings)

Additionally, Citron Research (lol) has come out with a $100 price target (lmfao) on the stock, parroting the simplistic narrative of “the next Amazon” that appeals to these stupid Robintwats. This is especially hilarious because Citron was one of the first to call out “the company during its first post-IPO earnings report in 2019, with claims of fraud and “material discrepancies” in its S1 filing. Just a few months later Jumia disclosed it had wrongly inflated its order volume by around $17.5 million due to some fraudulent orders, even though executives stated they had no impact on financial statements.”

(for context, this was about 5% of their sales in that quarter, although it probably ran deeper than what they admitted— Citron claimed 20-30% inflation initially)

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/04/23/jumia-africas-failed-unicorn-is-hemorrhaging-millions/?sh=56268a5764e4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/04/23/jumia-africas-failed-unicorn-is-hemorrhaging-millions/?sh=56268a5764e4)

It’s pretty obvious that Citron is pumping the stock to enter a short position at higher prices, which is a tactic they’ve used before (look at RVLV they pumped its IPO)— inversing Citron has been a super profitable strategy for me over the years (especially shopify) and there's no reason to doubt this will continue.

**B) Unsound business model in the long term**

**Supply chain generally sucks, which makes e-commerce unprofitable even though its growing**

Unreliable postal service and lack of formalized addresses, no large transportation companies that have optimized costs and have large last mile delivery systems (aka UPS/FedEx), difficulty and extra costs like tax/tariff for cross-border transactions, largely underbanked population so cash on delivery is main payment system (even JumiaPay is only used on 35% of orders on Jumia platform).

That’s why the company has been consistently losing money on every order. Because of these losses, they will need to raise capital again within the next year to continue operating (less than 1y of working capital left based on its current cash burn) —> this means share issuances and further dilution at best, bankruptcy at worst.

You have to be able to sustain massive losses to continue to grow in the African e-commerce market— Jumia is too small, and with its history of fraud will never be able to get the capital it needs to dominate and become the AMZN/MELI of Africa. More likely is that 10 years later when Africa is more developed and e-commerce is more profitable (or at least less unprofitable), Amazon itself and Alibaba will takeover.

**The current addressable market is not as large as you think**

Only high income/upper middle income urban citizens who have access to bank accounts can currently be served, and due to income inequality and the rural/urban divide in Africa, this is not that many people.

Because of the large amount of defective products/counterfeits sold in Africa through Chinese drop-shipping scams, these consumers often like to touch products and see them/pay for them in person. This requires more fulfillment costs and less use of Jumia payment platform.

Additionally, there has been no COVID bump in Africa like every other e-commerce company had this year— in fact, GMV (total value of goods bought on platform) dropped 13% YoY last quarter and their guidance saw “continued softness” due to COVID’s economic impact.

Because of the shitty supply chain and lack of rapid growth, Jumia has been exiting more countries in Africa than it has been entering (left Tanzania, Cameroon, Rwanda, Congo, Gabon, etc) as it just can’t grow enough to justify losing as much money as it does. This is also tough for the only bright spot in the business, which is the fast growing JumiaPay. There are tons of competing payment platforms in Africa and in order to scale and compete against them, JumiaPay needs the networks effects from a successful e-commerce platform, which is not likely to materialize.

Quarterly results on November 10 will catalyze the dump just like it did back in August, because the numbers will continue to show that Jumia is not growing all that fast (revenue/GMV may even drop again), and it is losing a lot of money while doing so.

**C) Massive unrest in major market will affect future guidance**

Jumia’s biggest market is Nigeria. If you haven’t been reading the news, throughout October, there has been massive unrest in the country due to protests against police violence. Protestors blocked streets and destroyed buildings, troops were deployed and fired on people, and curfews were imposed.

This unrest likely delayed fulfillment of many orders, caused cancellations, and lowered economic activity/demand. The company will have to disclose how results have been affected in the upcoming earnings call guidance, which will be another reason the stock will sell off.

AMZN,Walmart earnings play 11/20 🚀🚀🚀,1605539062.0,"Walmart reporting earnings on Nov 17 morning.  It's going to be a complete blow out, like that 10% earnings pop a few quarters ago.

Not only are earnings tomorrow so we get immediate satisfaction, IV is at an all time low.  This is absolutely a sign of good times to come.  Walmart is a boomer company, and they are typically very open to analyst days.  

With Walmart keeping hush hush and this much earnings creep with falling IV, Walmart is about to announce majority market share of Xbox and ps5 pre orders.

Walmart is also the preferred retailer for Joe Six Pack by sticking it to the AMZN elites.  

Parler, the newest and greatest platform since sliced bread is heavily promoting Walmart, where masks are optional and little fear for your wives.  70 million conservatives will be sticking it to the tech libs by buying the new Walmart plus subscription service.

Disney had blowout Disney plus numbers, Walmart going to surprise us tomorrow with so bomb Walmart plus numbers.

AMZN,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why,1605176800.0," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say."
AMZN,Buffet and Papa Musk anime crossover?,1605715411.0,"~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)

Based on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. 

This is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.
@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.

According to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.

The BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.

Indeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:

Q2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B
Q1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B
Q4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B

So the current $16.5B difference is not normal.
The BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.

Assuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?

Another important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm

Furthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:

1) $AAPL
2) $AMZN
3) $BRK
4) $V
5) $JNJ
6) $JPM
7) $PG
8) $MA
9) $BAC
10) $KO

There are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ

None of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.

If it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...
25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:

https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html

So did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months."

Hope you made some money on my CRSR DD. I'm now looking at OSTK goin into Black Friday. If you've been on it this year you've probably had some 5-10x baggers. Summer was crazy. Huge drop from ATH but it's signaling a run for the next 2 weeks and has bullish technicals and catalysts.

Overstock.com, INC. $OSTK NASDAQ currently at $62.25 per share going into 11/23/2020.

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah, near Salt Lake City. Patrick M. Byrne founded Overstock.com in 1999.

Market Cap: 2.64b

2nd Quarter Bullish Points:

OSTK AMZN BABA W and other online retailers were oversold over the last month. Election volatility fucked everybody up, then Vaccine news rotated the market and clearly the consumer services sector was hit hard. This is a buying opportunity for OSTK. I'm not saying the market can't drop and take these down further with it, we're due for that - but the support is clear on every ticker I just mentioned and the channel I'm seeing OSTK break out of is worth posting about especially going into Black Friday.

They're going to blow away next earnings after Holiday Season with online sales but OSTK doesn't just sell couches, and earnings isn’t til March.  The real potential for growth comes with their efforts in FinTech.

EDIT: I would go more into this catalyst but wsb rules don't allow it. Basically Overstock is that dude that has a steady job but also has a side hustle that can make him even more money. The SEC allows OSTK to manage and trade shitcoins. Overstock was one of the first major retailers in 2014 to accept shitcoin as a payment. Go look at the price of shitcoin in 2014. OSTK has been selling futons and lamps in exchange for shitcoin for 6 years. Checkmate. tZERO is owned by Overstock and their software ATS tokenizes assets for businesses. This is in high demand right now as you’ll read in the coming weeks. They have inked new deals with Wall St. firms recently and are on the verge of some very bullish deals. We're in the middle of a shitcoin bullrun. Look it up. This is the real catalyst.

Regardless, the technicals are what drew me to this play:

OSTK is down 50% from their ATH's. Anyone who traded it this year knows how ridiculous the gains can be. When this moves, this moves fast. 716.93% yearly increase is nothing to joke about. The fact that it didn't drop below 50 in November is hella bullish to me. Made its way back above 60 on Friday. 63 is where the fun begins.

https://i.imgur.com/iQylnIn.png

Trading in an extremely tight range for a bullish breakout. If OSTK opens above 62.95 on 11/23 it should test 77.5 by 11/27. If it breaks above that earlier, next price target is 85.10. Beyond that, ATH's. Breaking 61.25 to 56.17 bearish down to 52.79 potentially, but I don't think that will happen.

I see 70 coming easily if volume picks up early in the week.

Historically, Thanksgiving week is green and looking at futures right now I'm expecting more of the same. I closed my CRSR positions, went into last Friday with SPY puts and sold end of day for a nice gain. Although I do see some potential downside for SPY, this market is fucking retarded so SPY 360 is just as possible. Nasdaq doesn't really seem to give a shit either way. I'm generally bearish but honestly I should've just put the money I made on CRSR into OSTK because this shit can fly all week. The market cap is so low for a company like this so high volume sends it as you can see from their performance all 2020. OSTK is worth 2.6b after selling off nearly 50% from ATH's but I wouldn't be surprised if it opened up big Monday after breaking out of the downward trend last week. Lots of eyes on it. The room for it to run up is insane considering catalysts like Black Friday, Holidays, lockdowns, shitcoin mooning and growing potential in FinTech space. I'm long OSTK.

I could have added bear gang but we all know they don't need help getting out of the closet.

So, lets talk WuFlu. The numbers we've seen in the past few weeks have absolutely obliterated all previous records with the introduction of sustained cold weather for the first time since we all hunkered down and put $10k on SPY 200P 4/20. Jpow rammed his fat printing cock up all our asses and we screamed in glee and agony; confused by the pleasure of getting the money fucked out of us.

A lot of bulls got a taste of the forbidden fruit, they wondered if they might also be a little bit bear inside. But as soon as Jpow finished blowing his first load, all the bulls loaded up on TSLA weeklies hundreds of dollars OTM, desperate to ride that cock rocket to the moon. Quick! they said, AMZN 2200c 6/4! ZM 250C 7/17! Screaming 'daddy yes!' as they desperately clung to the throbbing veins of Jerome's phallic federal fury.

Yes, they got tendies, and yes the bears may even be asexual now, too afraid to even take a position in fear of the mighty jpow raw-dogging. But what does that say about you, bulls? Are you ready to embrace that you might even be gayer than the bears? Has Jerome pushed you so hard that you're the sub and you don't even know?

Food for thought. I am actually interested to know what all you homos think is going to happen. If current trends continue, we're well over 300k cases a day by Christmas.

Of course, the elephant in the room being NIO. There are a few fundamental reasons why this stock is a trap. The valuation is just pure bullshit. You now Mercedes benz? The company that builds the sedans dictators use and the AMG horsepower machines you will never be able to afford? Right. Well that company is worth € 52.2 Billion in market cap. Guess what NIO is worth? Huh? Motherfucker they are worth € 56.7 Billion. Now let’s compare vehicles sales for the year 2019. Mercedes Benz sold 2.3 Million cars and NIO sold 29000 cars.

Don’t get me wrong, I like a good pump and dump like the next guy, but this shit is just too retarded for me. I know you all are sad you missed the tesla tendie train but this is not the way. Looking at the valuation and vehicle sales NIO seems to be way overvalued. But what concerns me more is the fact that its based in china. A country that does not prosecute CEO’s of companies that turned out the have cooked books. These companies have cost the western investors millions of dollars. They turn out to be complete frauds and once the market realized the shares drop to almost nothing. This has been going on since the financial crisis of ’08 and no significant improvements to the situation have been made since then. So, the saying “This time will be different” will fuck you over. Please educate yourself about china and its strategies by watching the following documentary on Netflix: The China hustle. And consider who owns the platform we use to discuss these strategies and how they might take advantage of that.

Here is a section from the Wikipedia page of the china hussle:

“The film reveals that actual revenues of Chinese firms (reflected in their filings with Chinese government entities) were typically one tenth of what was filed with the SEC.\[11\] Subsequent to investigations, most of the firms were de-listed from the NYSE resulting in losses of billions to US investors.\[12\] The film concludes with a closing sequence that highlights the continued lack of regulatory oversight in Chinese securities fraud - out of approximately 400 Chinese companies, only 1 CEO in China went to jail for fraudulent reverse mergers - and alludes that Alibaba Group's and other existing Chinese firm's continuing claims of high growth rates might be just as fraudulent.”

And if you are desperate for positions go make an earnings play on RKT or fucking invest in cruiselines with a possible upside of 70% pre corona. But remember, China is asshoo.

I have been tracking all of the terrible decisions of this community through my automated collection techniques. Here is the weekly summary of best performing picks and pickers. I take no accountability for any mistakes in this data, as I am a computer program created by a r/wallstreetsbets user, which we all know means he has limited intellectual capabilities.

I tracked **50 total picks** over the last week and of those picks **27 picks had a positive ROI**  and **13 picks had negative ROI.**

# The combined ROI for all picks tracked for WSB over the last 7 days was 21.69%(nice).

AMZN,Predictable Rise,1604902222.0,"And a fall soon after...here we go again with the upside of the volatility.  Just wait--in a week or 2, after we get clear of earnings, suddenly the reports of infections will hit home, or Trump won't concede, or the fact that so many people are screwed financially because of the shut down and lack of stimulus, or simply because the seasons have changed.  Then we'll get a nice dip.  And all those who said ""buy the dip"" will be shaken with doubt and fear that this time it will drop out...meanwhile, big smart money will once again pick up sale-priced stocks and crush it, again.

One of the stocks I've played now 2x on this cycle is AMZN.  I bought stock and debit spreads when it was around 3030 a couple of weeks ago when everyone was selling.  

&#x200B;

Not saying we won't continue to go up for a bit, but my bet is we see a good dip here again at some point before end of year."

According to these guys I still got 16k worth of buying power, so tell me about an undervalued stock and I might actually buy it. Don't tell me about a 10 billion dollar company that is trading at 20x sales that just had some 15 million dollar deal that will do great things for it.

AMZN,NNDM and ArkQ,1606149074.0,"Now I'm not sure if nndm is a penny stock anymore or what, since someone said pennystocks are sub $5 but i thought it had to have a billion dollar mc not to be one.

Besides the point ArkQ bought 1million shares on friday and adding 50% more to their position of NNDM. NNDM dropped friday due to an offering of $100million offering that closes today. They said this money will be used to buy out another company and help with other business operations. 

Well doing research on Cathie Wood on 3d printing, i came across an interview where she talks about 3d printing has got hit the hardest in their eyes and talked about certain stocks down 80-90%. NNDM matched this description.

I want to your guys views on 3d printing and this stock where, acording to the ArkQ portfolio, they own more nndm than amzn, isrg, nvda, and appl (not combine). Now a days 3d printing  machines are everywhere and personally theres one at my local library. You think nndm will go back to its launch day price around $60-$70?"
AMZN,Thoughts on JD Stock?,1605028822.0,"Been wanting to acquire JD, basically China's Amazon, but I think now's a great time. Biden just won the election, which should ease US-China tensions.

With Pfizer's vaccine announcement, JD fell \~12% in 2 days, however since China has already mostly opened up, I don't see a vaccine affecting JD's revenue.

At amount $80 per share, I think it has the potential to 3-5x in less than 2 years, considering AMZN, SHOP, and BABA's growth.

Any thoughts?"

AMZN,11/16/2020 New Options Position Strangles (Puts & Calls) Traders will be Long Theta & Short Gamma Profile (to take advantage of fall in implied & realized volatility) Expected Outperformance from 11/16/2020 to 11/27/2020 -Taking Advantage of Fall in realized volatility & overall market dispersion,1605559996.0,"**Want to Avoid the Small Print (Condensed version of the trade is pretty straight forward it is-Short Vol via short front dated options and a short Gamma Profile) End Goal make 2,000 Dollars This week :) \*Potential 5,000 in profit - (Exposure of 1.1M for two weeks)**

***Volatility Expectation =*** I expect the market to move less than 5% +/- over the next two weeks. Vix expectation is 1.13% to 1.57% (18 to 25) +/- and VVIX to move 7 to 10 points +/- or between 115 to 125

**Full Summary & Rational For Trade** Realized and Implied volatility will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks. This will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for two weeks selling premiums via writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the two weeks. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the full week.

AMZN,So Here's Your Big Short Opportunity,1605253666.0,"A lot of autists here love to watch the Big Short and get inspired to figure out a way to predict the next market crash.

Remember when Mike Burry shorted the housing market and tried to convince ppl it was an unprecedented scandal that involved the govt, banks, financial institutions, corporations egc and ppl told him he was batshit crazy?

Well here we are again. It's a total gaslight fuckathon that is making people similarly question their own  sanity.

This time is requires one to believe in systematic voter fraud, govt/media/social media corruption, censorship, psychological manipulation, and the widely unpopular, conspiracy theorist view that Orange will emerge victorious over Sleepy Joe. Make no mistake about it, if there is a Big Short sequel it will be about the autists who made a fortune bc they were right when everyone else was wrong.

I believe we're going to see a big sell off in the coming weeks followed by new record setting highs once Trump wins #46 in late Dec.

I went all in on SNAP about a year ago before earnings and lost close to 50% of my account balance due to gambling. Well this week I’ve made a KILLING playing both.. I must admit I got lucky considering I had no clue if earnings would be looked at as positive or negative.

AMZN,The death of the classic 60/40 portfolio,1604170417.0,"Bonds provide safe returns over a long period of time. If we replace the bonds in our portfolio with stocks/inflation linked bonds, returns will increase.

Bonds are used to hedge against a decline in stock prices. When interest rates across the globe are, at or close to zero (even negative in some cases) then nominal bond yields decrease substantially and can even have negative returns if inflation increases.

The US Fed has recently committed to keeping interest rates at or close to zero until 2023, have stated that they will continue to buy treasuries, at a rate $120B per month and will allow inflation to rise above above 2%. Due to these statements, it becomes clear that bonds will likely have low to negative returns for the foreseeable future.

With debt being so cheap and a deficit of 100% of US GDP (a potential 1-3 trillions dollar more to be printed), it becomes undeniable that higher inflation is here to stay. The result of this can be seen when looking at the current gold prices being at all time highs (gold is an inflation hedge), home sales in US and Canada being at all time highs (incredibly low mortgage rates makes it the best time to buy) and the DXY (the dollar against a basket of other currencies) being at a 2 year low, one can only conclude that, it is time to get out of bonds.

When a stock currently sits around at the top of a US stock market ranking for 5 months or so, I make sure to offset any post-bid gains by up to 25% of my post-bid profits. This seems reasonable to me. Then I have a very destructive thought process. I look at the trend since I think the stock was trending or not since it was MARCH 1 and I think long term. Is it still around though? - This is why crazy markets tend to stay cagier. You want to kill the red flag but still have a green light? YOLOs.

EDIT3:

I usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.

10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my gain so far have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.

EDIT4:

If you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one ""strategy"" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\~ or so from this.

But then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.

Learning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to ""outsmart"" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.

EDIT6:

Almost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)

EDIT7:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at the top of a current calendar year, I mean period, process is labor of sweat. More specifically, how many months do you have left in your current calendar year? That would be the biggest component I look at. (<3 months)

EDIT8:

Many people seem to miss key points in this post. Some will say this is part of the job. My job is to help people why other workers should too. My job is to help people anyway. Doesn't fucking matter which way you slice it.

GOOG,Buy Rackspace Technologies (RXT) ahead of tomorrows earnings,1604990912.0,"See my previous DD's for plays on [PLTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ja2ocr/why_im_ridiculously_bullish_on_palantir_pltr/), [CHGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiom0e/chegg_beat_earnings_they_sold_off_ah_heres_why/), [BA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz9c56/dd_time_to_buy_boeing_and_airlines_calls/),  [UAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkv6ds/uaa_beat_earnings_by_600/) (my backup account - I got temporarily banned from reddit for saying ""retard"" and ""autistic"" on another subreddit.  I guess I spend too much time on this sub). Also made a post on ENPH but I think it was removed. Anyways...

If you want a virgin ripe-for-taking play this week for earnings, i suggest you take a look into Rackspace. Here's my depiction:

&#x200B;

***What the fuck is Rackspace?***

* Rackspace is a cloud services provider that helps companies port data to Amazon Web Services, and also provides infrastructure management and managed application services.
* Rackspace helps Amazon  and Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, among others to move data around.[1](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)
* Rackspace was once a public company in 2008, but went private in 2016. They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&qs=n&sp=-1&pq=rackspace+ipo&sc=8-13&sk=&cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&first=7&FORM=PORE)
   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)

&#x200B;

***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***

* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began
   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.
* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.
   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***

Debt. [3.9 billion to be exact](https://www.thestreet.com/ipo/news/rackspace-technology-ipo-launch#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202020%2C%20Rackspace%20had%20%24125,flow%20during%20the%20twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2031%2C). yes, this is a lot. however, during the last ER, the CEO and CFO reiterated intentions to reducing this debt. i believe it is the ony reason this stock hasn't mooned like DDOG. with customers like amazon, microsoft, google, among others, i believe this company posts record revenue, as have many other cloud companies, and decreases debt substantially. This is a rocket ship folks.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12/18 17.5C  


  


EDIT: The stock took a dip after ER because Benzinga and seeking alpha scraped the 2019 3rd quarter results from the release. RXT beat EPS, revenue, and reduced debt. once people and the bots learn to read this will go higher. Listen to the earnings call at 5."
GOOG,"China is regulating their big tech now, does this mean US big tech can't hide behind competition as defense against anti-trust?",1605137431.0,"With the recent decision to regulate Ant group and the recent chill settling across China's big tech sector, the implications for US big tech are very large. 

One of the biggest defenses Big Tech has used to defend against anti-trust, is that they need to be that large to compete with china. Now that china has shown it's willing to tame those businesses, that argument is going to really fall flat with US regulators. 

Anyone care to point out why this is not the case?"
GOOG,Alphabet up 8% after ER,1604006103.0," 

Alphabet is higher after hours ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=news_body_link) \+8.4%, [GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=news_body_link) \+7.6%) following [Q3 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3628527-alphabet-eps-beats-5_19-beats-on-revenue?source=news_body_link)  where it easily surpassed Street estimates thanks to broad revenue  growth and (notably) increased ad spend in Search and YouTube, signs the  ad recovery has taken hold.

Revenues rose 14% to $46.17B; they were up 15% in constant currency.

Operating income rose 24% to $11.21B, and net income jumped to $11.25B from a year-ago $7.07B.

GOOG,"ADT, down 33% in 6 weeks. Earnings Report after hours on Thursday, Nov 5",1604369154.0,"Can somebody please convince me not to do this?! I feel like I’m taking CRAZY PILLS!!


So ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. 

Google bought a stake in them 3 months ago to acquire 6.7% of the company. Average price, $8.22. $450m worth of stock, pricing the company at a valuation of $6.7b. 

Current price, $6.70. Current valuation: $5.5b

Yes, GOOG is bagholding -18.5% on this. They have the option to acquire up to 9.99% of the company in total in the terms of their agreement.

The price shot from $8.50 to $17.00+ that day and spent a week or two selling off, down to something like $11-13.50 throughout the following days that ensued.

6 weeks after Google’s buy-in, there was a secondary public offering that then dropped the shares from $10.80 to $9.22 in a single day (-14% drop). Turns out it was the majority shareholder, Apollo Management, and they priced the shares at $10. Yes, ten dollars. The additional shares to market implied a dilution of 5.5% on the total float, yet the price dropped 15% likely because ADT was receiving no proceeds of the offering, by nature of it being an SPO by Apollo.

ADT $7.5c 11/20
  
ADT $10c 11/20

Earnings play. Thoughts??

TL;DR - ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. They are currently down 18.5% from when Google acquired 6.7% of their company three months ago. They are also down 33% from the price of their secondary public offering that was placed 6 weeks ago. Their last quarterly report was bullish on guidance.

EDIT: Good going guys, ADT calls are up 200%, from $0.15 to $0.45 from this post. The underlying went from $6.50 to $8.00. I know the broader market rallied too in many ways, but go fuck yourselves"

GOOG,11/16/2020 New Options Position Strangles (Puts & Calls) Traders will be Long Theta & Short Gamma Profile (to take advantage of fall in implied & realized volatility) Expected Outperformance from 11/16/2020 to 11/27/2020 -Taking Advantage of Fall in realized volatility & overall market dispersion,1605559996.0,"**Want to Avoid the Small Print (Condensed version of the trade is pretty straight forward it is-Short Vol via short front dated options and a short Gamma Profile) End Goal make 2,000 Dollars This week :) \*Potential 5,000 in profit - (Exposure of 1.1M for two weeks)**

***Volatility Expectation =*** I expect the market to move less than 5% +/- over the next two weeks. Vix expectation is 1.13% to 1.57% (18 to 25) +/- and VVIX to move 7 to 10 points +/- or between 115 to 125

**Full Summary & Rational For Trade** Realized and Implied volatility will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks. This will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for two weeks selling premiums via writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the two weeks. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the full week.

GOOGL,Yall sleeping on Tim Apple - the next Tesla,1606046506.0,"Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards

So I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.

AAPL is the next TSLA.

TSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up.

Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all 🍎.

Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. 

Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.

Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Also AAPL finished an A, B, C correction? Some tard with more brain wrinkles can explain wave theory. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?

""I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tangent about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost""

Shrooms are fucking amazing.

Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?

""What will be the catalyst?"" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.

""But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-"" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.

I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time.

GOOGL,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why,1605176800.0," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say."

Another day, another GME post.

Power move or dumbass move selling consoles in store on black Friday? I think they are the only retailer to physically sell next gen consoles in store. Also, I think they're only selling bundles in store, driving up their margins/rev per console sold initially. Smart move as every gaming website/blog is talking about GameStop instead of Amazon/Best Buy because of this - but in terms of optics not sure how people will take it with the pandemic getting worse. I'm sure there will be pictures of lines on social media today.

Anyone have any calculations on estimated FCF and gross on the next gen console life cycle for GME?

PS4/XBONE sold \~ 115m and 50m respectively according to wikipedia over their cycle. If PS5/XBX sell 10-20% more units this cycle, that's around 20-35m units for Gamestop over the next few years ( plus bundles / attachments / trade ins / financing / etc ).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kvhsawwd7yy51.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=046e00a0fdfa506c59f944efe4498820698f6b0b

Short term, Sony said they expect to sell 7.6m PS5s by March 2021, so at least 1-2m can be expected to be sold by GME in the next 3-4 months. Not sure about Xbox estimates. \~49% of games sold are still physical, with the total gamer base increasing, the effect on decreasing physical sales isn't as dramatic. Further, parents/grandparents and others who buy games as gifts/presents (big driver of gaming sales) prefer to buy physical gifts.

I'm definitely over-simplifying here (console sales numbers are global, bulk of GME sales are in the US so the % share of sales will be lower than above), but the premise still stands and I think they have a great opportunity to turn profitable by the end of the year.

Oh and this is totally ignoring Switch sales, and all the other things that GME sells, including PC hardware and components. I don't believe the prophetic short squeeze will happen, but I do think the stock will moon soon based on the business itself once the company shakes off its 'in financial distress' reputation amongst investors.

Now that the bankruptcy thesis is pretty much dead in the water with management voluntarily retiring 60% of their debt using cash flow from operations, what will the next big catalyst will be? Clearly this is a huge signal to the market that the business is healthy, and management is bullish on FCF and sales targets for the next few quarters/years.

I buy several times a week from them but I'm the biggest enemy of Amazon Choice and Best Seller .
I used to sort by reviews/stars but now sends you to unrelated items. Even though many fake reviews. 

LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators have filed antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using data to gain an unfair advantage over merchants using its platform.
The EU's executive commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday that the charges have been sent to the company.
The commission said it takes issue with Amazon's systematic use of non-public business data to avoid “the normal risks of competition and to leverage its dominance"" for e-commerce services in France and Germany, the company's two biggest markets in the EU.
The EU started looking into Amazon in 2018 and has been focusing on its dual role as a marketplace and retailer.

In addition to selling its own products, the U.S. company allows third-party retailers to sell their own goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.
Amazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.
“We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,” the company said in a statement.
The company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.
It’s the EU’s latest effort to curb the power of big technology companies, following a series of multibillion dollar antitrust fines against Google in previous years."

**The Big Short**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.
* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

EDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:

First I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying ""bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg"", ur momma's a hoe.

Ok, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.

Then again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.

Anyways let's look at some price ratios:

* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.
* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.
* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.

Don't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.

Subsidiaries & Partnerships:

In a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:

* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.
* Qwest, subsidy.
* Prism TV, subsidy.
* Savvis, subsidy.
* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.
* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.
* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.
* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)

The list goes on and on.

New Market Enterprises:

The estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.

The aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me. At least this isn't a fucking mattress company.

GOOGL,Buy Rackspace Technologies (RXT) ahead of tomorrows earnings,1604990912.0,"See my previous DD's for plays on [PLTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ja2ocr/why_im_ridiculously_bullish_on_palantir_pltr/), [CHGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiom0e/chegg_beat_earnings_they_sold_off_ah_heres_why/), [BA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz9c56/dd_time_to_buy_boeing_and_airlines_calls/),  [UAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkv6ds/uaa_beat_earnings_by_600/) (my backup account - I got temporarily banned from reddit for saying ""retard"" and ""autistic"" on another subreddit.  I guess I spend too much time on this sub). Also made a post on ENPH but I think it was removed. Anyways...

If you want a virgin ripe-for-taking play this week for earnings, i suggest you take a look into Rackspace. Here's my depiction:

&#x200B;

***What the fuck is Rackspace?***

* Rackspace is a cloud services provider that helps companies port data to Amazon Web Services, and also provides infrastructure management and managed application services.
* Rackspace helps Amazon  and Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, among others to move data around.[1](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)
* Rackspace was once a public company in 2008, but went private in 2016. They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&qs=n&sp=-1&pq=rackspace+ipo&sc=8-13&sk=&cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&first=7&FORM=PORE)
   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)

&#x200B;

***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***

* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began
   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.
* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.
   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***

Debt. [3.9 billion to be exact](https://www.thestreet.com/ipo/news/rackspace-technology-ipo-launch#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202020%2C%20Rackspace%20had%20%24125,flow%20during%20the%20twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2031%2C). yes, this is a lot. however, during the last ER, the CEO and CFO reiterated intentions to reducing this debt. i believe it is the ony reason this stock hasn't mooned like DDOG. with customers like amazon, microsoft, google, among others, i believe this company posts record revenue, as have many other cloud companies, and decreases debt substantially. This is a rocket ship folks.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12/18 17.5C  


  


EDIT: The stock took a dip after ER because Benzinga and seeking alpha scraped the 2019 3rd quarter results from the release. RXT beat EPS, revenue, and reduced debt. once people and the bots learn to read this will go higher. Listen to the earnings call at 5."
GOOGL,PSA: it’s nearly impossible to discharge your student loan debts in bankruptcy court.,1605135878.0,I’ve seen too many of you retards gamble your student loans and think “hEhE I cAN jUsT dEcLaRe BaNkRuPtCy.” You have to prove undue hardship to get your student loans discharged in basically any court in the United States. It’s fucking impossible. Google it for 5 seconds before you yolo that loan. I don’t give a fuck if this gets downvotes it needs to be said.
GOOGL,When you are too retarded to remember the name of the sub,1603832553.0,
GOOGL,"What are examples of ""cannot-fail"" stocks that ended up crashing and staying down?",1604134432.0,"There are some companies today that, at a glance, might just seem too big to fail (say, google, microsoft, apple, amazon, alibaba, etc). 

This made me wonder, have there been examples in the past of similarly large companies that everyone/most assumed couldn't fail, but ended up crashing down and staying there? I'm not necessarily asking about companies that had comparable assets, but rather about companies that were similarly perceived by many as ""too big to fail""."
GOOGL,The South Korean gaming stock no one has heard of that will 10x : GRVY,1606187781.0,"In South Korea, out of the country's 51.6 million population, 29 million play video games. If the U.S. has the NBA and NFL, South Korea has esports. It's that popular.

The country's most popular video-game developer is **Gravity (Nasdaq: GRVY)**. And for a few reasons, its shares could jump as much as 10-fold in the coming years...

The company's revenues have grown an average of 91% a year over the past three years.

Now, the company is introducing four new online games this year...

One is Ragnarok Origin, which launched in South Korea in July. It immediately became the fourth-top-grossing game in both Google Play and Apple's App Store.

Another is Ragnarok X: Next Generation, which recently launched in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the rest of Southeast Asia.

That means business is going to dramatically pick up the pace, and then bulldoze right on to record levels in 2021, as these new games fully contribute to the bottom line.

**The Most Undervalued Gaming Stock**

The words ""gaming stock"" and ""undervalued"" rarely go together.

That's because most gaming stocks are either, 1) small, unprofitable newcomers hoping to score that one hit game that turns it into an overnight sensation... or 2) large, expensive enterprises like Tencent or Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

Gravity has been in the video-gaming business longer than both of these industry giants, though. And in that time, it has managed to build up a franchise potentially worth many times more than what investors are valuing the company at today.

The result is a company much cheaper than its competitors... and honestly, much cheaper than it ever should be, given its growth potential.

Gravity is cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis than any of the top four video-game companies.

The games already in the market are topping the charts in Google Play and the Apple App Store. And because this is a successful, long-running franchise, odds are heavily in its favor of sustaining that level of growth in the coming year.

Moreover, Gravity is doing this in the world's fastest-growing video-gaming market – Southeast Asia... where gaming is more than doubling the rate of growth in the rest of the world.

While global gaming revenues grew 5% in 2019, Southeast Asia witnessed a 16% jump. And Gravity is deeply entrenched in these emerging markets... the Next Chinas of the 21st century.

Right now, with a market cap of just $900 million, Gravity is an unpolished gem just waiting to be noticed by investors. It just hasn't yet had its time to shine.

Just as an example, NetEase – a major Chinese gaming company – is worth $65 billion alone today.

When you consider that NetEase started out as a sub-$500 million company when it first listed in the U.S., 10x is not only possible but likely. BUY GRVY AND MAKE A KILLING"
GOOGL,HTHT - The Next NIO / XPEV - Play the Chinese Consumer - The Marriott of China - HTHT,1606119579.0,"Not Financial Advice (""NFA"")

So since I've been on a mini hiatus from here. After correctly calling the DKNG/PTON/CRWD (Check post history) run-up & for those that got out early enough, some mini tendies on PM (if you held, I'm sorry, GTFO), I've been doing work behind the scenes & correctly called XPEV/NIO, CRSR, then TSLA. Proof below:

XPEV:

TSLA:

I still hold a majority of the above positions, though I've reduced some XPEV/CRSR primarily due to its run-up making the positions become too big. TSLA, even after my selldown is still a significant part of my portfolio.

With that said - here's some good ol' fundamental DD for you folks on my next play. **Huazhu Hotels Group (NASDAQ: HTHT)**. **This will be long, I'll try to be short & succinct & below I've included a TL;DR; but maximum tendies will be gifted to those who learn 2 read**.

**I. 30,000 Feet Up - China's 14th 5-Year Plan**

My HTHT thesis aligns with what got me into XPEV at the $20s. Even if you don't take my word for it, Google around - the foundation of the Chinese economy is based on Government policy. It isn't like the US, where big money drives political processes in the shadows. In China, decisions about medium-term / long-term business begin in the political sphere. So, on October 29th, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (""CCP""), wrapped up after meeting for 4 days on the high level themes of China's [14th 5-Year Plan](https://www.ft.com/content/8e60bf15-2005-442c-ae59-e51d74a93856). The final details will be announced around March/April of 2021 (which drives my reasoning why XPEV/NIO & other related stocks should be held to after this date), at which the market will be able to apply more than estimates/qualitative assessments to beneficiaries of this plan. HTHT & XPEV/NIO fall under all 3 ""Key Themes"" of the Plan which are:

1. *Theme #1: Domestic Dependency - New Energy - Electronic Vehicles & Related Supply Chain (Battery Tech & EV Charging Piles)* \--> XPEV / NIO
2. *Theme #2: Domestic Demand / Theme #3: Digitization - Value-Added Products/Content* \--> HTHT

Other big picture drivers are ongoing Dollar weakness relative to the Yuan, China's outperformance in handling COVID relative to the US & Europe, both of which I won't discuss in great detail here but are easily researchable. These are all additional tailwinds for HTHT.

How successful has China been on implementing past ""5-Year Plans""? Below is a nice infographic summarizing them. It's almost safe to assume that 5-Year Plan targets are the floor cases of what China is striving to achieve:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhech1vp0y061.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a873e9ed26e3ac980a38a7e435a67845b8d072a5

What are the benefits to Chinese businesses that align themselves with Chinese government policy? Cheap capital & outsized governmental support. *Put simply: It's like having a JPoW picking certain industries every 5 years to unleash the money printer on + having Congress pass very biz friendly laws in tandem.*

**II. 10,000 Feet Up - China's Only Trade Deficit - Service Sectors**

Overall, China has an overall significant trade surplus over the US (+$3.5 Trillion), but a deficit in the following 5 sectors - Domestic Travel, Discretionary Consumption, Entertainment, Education & Drugs & Medical Devices.

My view is that China will be pushing to create surpluses in all of them, but the most realistic sectors are in Domestic Travel / Discretionary Consumption (HTHT + XPEV/NIO) & a bit on the Healthcare side, which I'm exploring at the moment (DD to come). I still think US-based entertainment (Hollywood, NBA, etc.) will not be replaced in our lifetimes so let's focus on hotels.

Currently HTHT's portfolio is split by # of rooms 49% vs. 51% of total in the Upper/Midscale vs. Economy segment. Below is a quick summary of their portfolio of brands:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wbtzyyg01y061.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc8cde772bf3cdf54eb524c3aa2506d477cfba77

While many of these brands may not be familiar to us autists here vs. the brands Marriott / Hilton / Hyatt have, you can bet that with the signing of largest trade agreement signed in history - the [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.ft.com/content/2dff91bd-ceeb-4567-9f9f-c50b7876adce) & the quicker recovery from COVID in China, that these brands will be on flagship real estate assets across the world in the near future.

As an aside, Wall Street estimates that HTHT grows Room count by \~30% from year end 2020 to year end 2021, for an eventual mix weighted more towards the Upper/Midscale segment (56% vs. 44%, Upper/Midscale vs. Economy)

**III. Ground Level - HTHT Business Strategy & Financials**

So a very quick primer on how Hotels make money. There are 2 strategies - franchise / leased/operated. The Franchise strategy is higher margin, higher certainty of cash flows, is lower volatility, and captures *some* upside if business improves drastically. The leased/operated model is lower certainty of cash flows, higher volatility, and receives a bulk of outsized upside in the business. Overall, investors assign a much higher multiple to the franchise model. Taking a look at Marriott's historical EV/EBITDA vs. Host Hotels (HST)'s will show you this clearly. (Marriott trades >20x, HST \~10-15x)

Basically, how all the current major hotel brands started, like Marriott, was by having a primarily leased/operated model then when their brands began gaining awareness, spun-off their leased/operated business (usually to a hotel REIT) & became a primarily franchise business. This has been the path of all of the major hotel chains in the past, & if you were an investor in Marriott then, you made out like a bandit today (15x gains through time period).

Currently, HTHT's Revenue mix of franchise / leased/operated hotels is 31%/69% by Revenues. According to a survey by Frost & Sullivan in July 2020 on the Chinese consumer, HTHT's brand, HanTing Hotel is the #1 economy hotel brand that is 'top of mind' for the Chinese consumer & HTHT's midscale brand JI Hotel is #1 in the midscale segment. Brand momentum outside of the US has steadily been climbing for years which coincides with the Company's recent shift in becoming 'asset-lite' or in autist speak, are going to pursue a primarily Franchise model.

With that said - Wall Street estimates HTHT's franchised business is set to grow by >100% from '20 to '21, and the Revenue mix is set to go from 69% from Leased/Operated today to low 60%s by '22E.

This will be driven by a quicker & already recovering economy in China + global expansion backed by government policy.

Here's a snapshot on China's hotel recovery vs. other major cities per STR (based on RevPAR - Google if you don't know what this is - this is the main Hotel Revenue metric combining ADR & Occupancy):

&#x200B;

[Pay attention to growth from Aug '20 to Oct '20 - Beijing +51&#37; vs. London -3&#37; vs. Hong Kong +37&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/mnp64ghz4y061.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f25ffa0170142def79515f52e866541dd42100)

[Beijing +51&#37; \(from earlier\) vs. NYC +2&#37; vs. Tokyo +79&#37; - Overall: Asia's travel sector is recovering](https://preview.redd.it/1jxte0vg5y061.jpg?width=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3174187b78f1464457ac337219ba274901becd5d)

*In addition to the above RevPAR metrics, something else to note from the numbers. At Beijing's $55.01 RevPAR, they are >50% recovered from the average RevPAR throughout 2019 vs. London where current RevPAR is still \~20% of what they accomplished in 2019. Though Tokyo had some massive growth, they are still only \~33% of 2019s RevPAR*

Have you read this far yet? Lucky you - you get my exit strategy. $65/Share.

**So they're just going to be the Chinese Marriott - so what? What** ***differentiates*** **them like XPEV/NIO?**

**Growth.**

The Hotel industry hit the shittiest of shit recently, so all of them are coming off of ridiculously low bases. Even then, HTHT is expected to grow their EBITDA from '20 to '22E at a +209% CAGR vs. Marriott at +62%, and Hilton at +57%.

These estimates are extremely conservative in my view - downplaying HTHT getting the backing like NIO/XPEV to *export* its product overseas + the rapidly recovering Chinese economy relative to the US. Again, you will see their brands become flags in major cities in the coming years.

From a Valuation perspective, HTHT has had a decent run-up in the last month since the CCP unveiled the rough outline of their 5-Year plan, & they released [preliminary 3Q'20 results](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/huazhu-group-limited-announces-preliminary-results-for-hotel-operations-in-the-0) (which show a much improved/improving outlook - significant recovery in mid/upscale brands) but it is still undervalued in my view relative to the major Hotel peers. This is evident in EV/EBITDA.

Even with the conservative case of 3x the growth embedded in estimates vs. Marriott, HTHT trades at EV/EBITDA of \~20x, vs. Hyatt at \~24x, Marriott at \~19x, & Hilton at \~19.5x. Historically, Marriott has traded at \~22x when expectations for growth were a lot lower than they are today.

**Conclusion:**

**I see HTHT getting to >22x EV/EBITDA very quickly or \~$70+ a Share, and this is on estimates that do not fully account for franchise expansion on CCP support.**

**TL;DR $55C+, 3/2021 & beyond**

GOOGL,Dropbox getting more popular. Opinions?,1605955237.0,"What are your opinions In Dropbox? Since this summer I see more and more people on YouTube, Reddit and on other platforms that talk about Dropbox as If it is the next great tech darling. I like DBX and I think it will do well, but I doubt it will quadrouple in the next 5 years as some suggest.

Also, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.

Here are my thoughts:

Talking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.

Financials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.

Product. I use dropbox at work and at home with my family and I really like the fact that it's UI is easy to understand and use, when comparing it to OneDrive and GoogleDrive. So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. 

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.
Pretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.
CEO and co-founder leaves the company
Meh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.


Based on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.


*Full disclosure, I Have a long position in DBX

GOOGL,Costco’s (COST) expansion into China seems to be a massive success so far?,1604860343.0,"The average Costco warehouse in western countries average around 60k subscriptions. In other Asian countries a warehouse might get around 100k subscriptions after 2 years of being open. 

After the Warehouse in Shanghai opened in late 2019, its subscription count grew to 250k in under 3 months. With the warehouse shutting down local traffic and being forced to close early due to the chaos that ensued on opening day. 

Costco plans on opening a second warehouse in Suzhou. And may grow more rapidly after  they gain more experience with operating in China. 

""We typically open 2-3 locations in a country, and see how they operate over the first couple of years, ... We are off to a good start with our first opening last year."" - Richard Galanti, CFO, 

""It may take a couple of years to improve efficiencies. That’s one of the reasons why we generally go slow in new countries because we want to get it right from customer experience and also from the operational side,"" he added.

With China’s growing middle class and Costco’s brand being extremely popular among the Chinese... It could be plausible that China will end up becoming the majority of Costco’s revenue one day?

GOOGL,JMIA is hot garbage and you should short it immediately,1605863565.0,"Listen up degenerates, there is a huge shorting opportunity forming and it's name is JMIA. For those of you who don't know, JMIA is the alleged 'Amazon of Africa' by people who know absolutely nothing about the difference between Amazon and JMIA and probably even less about Africa. The stock has seen just an absolutely stupid run up in the past month (\~60%) and is prone to extreme volatility anyway, leading me to believe JMIA will correct imminently if not in the next few months.

To make this digestible for you morons, I'm going to break this into 3 parts: (1) why the African market is super challenging, (2) why the future is looking even grimmer, and (3) why the company is dog shit.

**The** **African market**  
So for those of you who have only a cursory grasp of a world existing outside the US, it may come as a shock to you that Africa is not in fact a country and it is not in fact one market. In reality, Africa is many countries - 54 to be exact (depending on who you ask). And apart from being 54 countries, Africa is also probably >10x as many 'markets'.

Why you ask? Well, African countries happen to be some of the most culturally and linguistically diverse on the planet. In Nigeria alone (JMIA's biggest market), there are easily over 10 major languages, many of which are associated with different 'ethnic' groups in different regions of the country that, had they been left to their own nation state evolution instead of subject to colonially imposed border drawing, would have almost certainly been separate countries.

In addition to being a highly fragmented market landscape, African countries boast some of the lowest literacy and numeracy rates in the world (google it yourself) and they are not improving very quickly. This makes it quite hard for a smartphone based app that depends on people reading and using the internet to actually grow their user base even if population is growing rapidly across Africa.

Finally, the infrastructure is shit in 90% of JMIA's core markets. Some of the worst roads and logistics chains you can imagine are there, and the vast majority of countries in Africa don't even use physical addresses. You can imagine the long-term challenges that a delivery service might face in these circumstances.

**The future**  
Covid is not doing any favors to the economic climate across the continent either. Unlike the US and the EU, African countries rarely have the luxury of providing stimmy money and running the printer. Inflation and government debt are already extremely high in the majority of JMIA's core markets, so trying to stimulate economic demand is not in the cards.

Furthermore, a huge chunk of these economies is dependent on demand from the US, China, the EU. If the demand dries up there, it just gets passed down the line a few months later.

**The company is dog shit**  
This is perhaps the most-compelling reason to short the stock: the company just isn't that good. Sure they're in a challenging market with a bleak future outlook, but they just aren't up to the challenge at hand (few are by the way).

To illustrate this point, take a look at their recent developments and their numbers. For one, they have *exited 3 separate countries in the past year.* Exited. As in gave up, weren't up to the task, called it quits. You may look at that and say 'well that's a good sing; it just means they're concentrating on their more profitable markets'. To which I say, um no, it means they have shitty market intelligence and entering countries they know fucking nothing about and have to abandon ship.

In terms of their numbers, they leave a ton to be desired to say the least. Much of their growth over the past few years has been squarely on the back of incentivizing the shit out of people using their platform and incurring large losses as a result.

Found this to be an excellent read and would love to hear what /investing has to say. Full article below: 

&#x200B;

It is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of “value” investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (“book”) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as “eyeballs” or “engagement”. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up “the opportunity”.

Plenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America’s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals—stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.

This would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today’s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

The job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock’s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital—from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company’s worth. A different approach is required—not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.

## Graham’s cracker

To understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds—notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities—which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.

This new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published “Security Analysis” (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham’s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. “The Intelligent Investor”, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham’s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.

Underpinning it all is an important distinction—between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm’s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.

The approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm’s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a “more reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism”. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.

The enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham’s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world’s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett’s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University’s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.

It helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency—and a validation of the value approach.

All this has had a lasting impact. Most investors “almost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say”, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that “value” has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind “growth” stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.

In Graham’s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.

In service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles—assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google’s search algorithm or Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company’s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company’s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can’t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.

## A beancounter’s nightmare

There are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles’ treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.

The treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset—either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as “goodwill”. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.

The second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are “non-rival” goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.

In their book “Capitalism Without Capital” Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm’s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade—Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China—have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects—think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).

Physical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable—hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.

The third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.

The distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst’s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first—call it the “steady state”—assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities—essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm’s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.

The nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. “You can’t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,” says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm—and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.

Picking winners in an intangible economy—and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success—is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.

## Up, up and away

Properly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham’s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.

The economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that’s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy."

This is going to fall and fall as people realise they have no paths to profitability left, because why the fuck would Waymo, Yandex or Baidu, (or Aurora) sell them Autonomous tech at face value, when they can dominate the sector themselves.

Uber are desperate for cash, they only have 6 billion left, and they know their only play is to sell stuff. They are selling the wrong unit though, Uber ATG lost them just 303 million in the last 9 months. Uber's primary business lost billions.

Selling ATG will probably give them 15 billion, which will be around 2 years of losing money, but they now have no strategy to become profitable. They are a perpetual money drain, heading towards collapse.

Last night, I laid in bed realizing this stock is only a couple months old and most of the world still doesn't even understand what it is they do.

Then I also considered that Soros' statement is bullish as fuck, because his message was basically a testament to the power and potential of Palantir. Soros basically said, ""I regret this unstoppable monster I helped create.""

After some quick bed time googling, I discovered Soros is also openly anti Facebook and anti Google. Me thinks it's mighty interesting Soros lumps these guys in with them. I also noted that his anti-tech efforts haven't done jack shit to slow those companies down.

>Our strong balance sheet and access to capital have enabled us to enter the U.S. through this strategic and accretive acquisition. We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization,"" said Irwin D. Simon, Aphria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We look forward to building upon the strengths of each of our respective and complementary brands, diversifying our product offering, broadening our consumer reach, and enhancing loyalty with consumers."" 

**Now listen, obviously this acquisition isn't the reason I'm writing this DD.**  

This acquisition isn't some golden goose, it's just enough to have gotten *more attention on this stock*. 


Let's take a quick look at APHA's charts:

https://imgur.com/gallery/9tuU16O?nc=1

As you can see on their YTD, they're back at their 52 week high. I believe this momentum is going to continue through the inauguration. Their chart appears to form a Cup and Handle Pattern on the 3 Month. They also have a ""Golden Cross"" but that wasn't exactly recent, although the bullish trend *has* panned out since it occured.

*Options are cheap, cheap, cheap, and oh boy do we have catalysts.* 

APHA has a very *very* interesting date for earnings. They will report on *January 14th.* One week prior to inauguration day. And wouldn't luck have it, there are options that expire on 1/15.

I believe that the combination of these two events will cause a brief rally in APHAs stock. I don't know how how high it would go, but it wouldn't need to go up much to make huge gains with calls. 

**Positions**: I currently hold 91 contracts of 1/15 10c and 10 of 1/15 20c (just lotto tickets, *probably* don't buy the 20cs lol). I plan on doubling down on my 1/15 10c position on Monday.

**There is substantial open interest in this position, which makes me think someone in the know is making this bet as well.**

 Open interest currently sits at 31.4k. The 7.5cs on the same date have an open interest of 27k.

Edit: To clarify **I don't *really* expect the stock to hit 10.** If it does then, wow, but this is a momentum play."

GOOGL,What you retards don't understand about China's EV market,1605461055.0,"Okay fellow retards, listen up. Like you, I'm sick and tired of all these fucking posts about $NIO. A lot of people have made a lot of money, but it's soared too high too fast, and we're all late to the party. So, like you, I'm looking for the next $NIO. Personally, I don't think it's any of these 3rd-tier EV companies that everyone seems to be piling on at the moment. $FSR could be promising, but until they're actually producing, it's going to reach its ceiling pretty fast.

The thing that folks seem not to understand is that China's mandate for electric vehicles goes far beyond these niche companies that are getting so much hype at the moment. Mark my words, neither $NIO, $XPEV, or $LI will gain a significant portion of China's EV market. That isn't to say that one or more of them won't succeed, but the speculation is just out of control. The bubble may not pop tomorrow, next week, or ever, but I think it will. China's largest manufacturers have the infrastructure to pump out way more vehicles to meet Pooh's quotas, and they are already doing so.

As far as I know, these larger companies aren't being traded. So, what's an autist to do with their monies? Enter CBAK, a Chinese lithium battery producer. (EDIT: mods, intending this post to open a discussion about this and other plays that might be flying under the radar rather than push CBAK specifically, please don't delete!)

In late September, they announced that they'd produced a tabless lithium battery that supposedly has a 25% increase in energy density at 20% less cost than Tesla's, their only real competitior. In fairness, I'm not completely certain whether these figures are relative to CBAK's previous battery or to Tesla's, but in either case they claim superior performance to Tesla's. They'll be rolling out this thing in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

Their ticker seems to banned here (too small of a market cap?) but just Google it. The time to have this on your radar was last Thursday, before it jumped about 60% on Friday, but is what it is.

CBAK already has a contract with Dongfeng motors, China's 2nd largest auto maker, which has its own EV fleet. They also make batteries for Haier, a major electronics company, so there's some diversification for you. Earnings and guidance come out EOD Monday, and I expect more to be announced, upon which this thing will moon even more than it already has. It was up to $7.00 from $3.90 at the end of Thursday on no apparent catalyst, then dipped under $6.00 and then up to $6.20 after hours. Hopefully it will dip in the meanwhile, but if you're counting on it, be ready to get fucked.

Position: \~$3k shares. Blew up 70% of my account YOLOing on SPY puts before the election and counting on this and BCRX to get me back in the game. No options available, sadly.

Edit: I'm sorry guys, really thought this one would simmer down for the day leading up to ER, but up 20% premarket. Will do you better next time--actually tried to post about it before, but the banned ticker thing came up and I had to figure out a way around it. Hopefully folks sell off before/after earnings but I think this still has plenty of upside. "

They did better than expected but for some reason the market didn't like it, why?"
GOOGL,"If you like money, invest in Oil Majors. This is why:",1604159299.0,"What should you buy?

Ideally, RDSA or other oil major Calls 6-12 months out. You can go for short term calls, but you have to deal with the short term volatility in the market. Either way, this shit is going up.   


What happened and why are Oil majors so low:    


Oil majors got hit very hard this year and lost a lot of value due to a combination of momentum, COVID, and short dicks.     

* Oil obviously got a huge hit by COVID, mostly because it's the most obvious thing to short when traveling stops. 

* Oil is very unpopular due to the trend in green investing, this moved institutions to unload their bags in the last years. [example](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=https://nos.nl/l/2354349&prev=search&pto=aue)

* Oil was considered boomer stuff by the new influx of retard investors who mostly invested in tech.

* Oil got hit harder because Saudi's with short penises who wanted to go measure dicks with Putin and US shale. [Source](https://sex-with-sander.blogspot.com/2013/05/average-penis-size-per-country-world.html)

Today, all this shit is priced in fundamentally and Oil majors are oversold by almost all TA. The market was kind of pricing in one of the majors to go down. They won't tho, oil is our drugs and we need our hits. 
This is one of these moments you look back at in a year and it will be so obvious in retrospect.


Good for Oil Majors:


**COVID Recovery**

COVID will end and we will be in a worldwide race to recovery. Oil is the most important input for this process and demand will be too big. Price can seriously accelerate to the upside:
    
* Demand will rise due to worldwide recovery
* Production will be lower due to cuts in many big projects with relatively high costs per barrel earlier this year.  
* Production will be much lower if Biden will stop US fracking.
* Overpopulation and the rising energy usage will just make us more addicted. India currently uses 2.5 bbl per day per 1000 people. China 6. Western countries use 40-60 bbl/day. Imagine yourself how these numbers will develop in the next 10 years. [source](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=91000)

**Price war ending**

Saudi Arabia is realizing that they did a very stupid thing and are now feeling the consequences, they are in the biggest financial trouble of the big oil countries and they pissed everybody off. The lack of foreign interest in the Aramco IPO was already a sign, but they also fucked up that and promised way too high dividends in order not to lose face. They need some kind of solution and higher oil prices are exactly that.

**Shift in Holders**

Prices are so low now that it will appeal to retards like us, you will see more people here talk about oil in the next months. It's one of the obvious sector rotations once we start looking forward. 

Institutions like pension funds made bad decisions by dumping at low prices due to social/green pressure but this was mostly a luxury hobby which they can't afford past COVID and with the low ratios they are facing. 

**And most importantly:**

We are addicted to oil, we continue to increase the average usage per person, and the world population keeps growing. [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/oil/#:~:text=World%20Oil%20Consumption&text=Global%20oil%20consumption%20per%20capita,gallons%20per%20capita%20per%20day.)

EV's and green energy are cool, but governments won't have money to pay for these luxuries for a long time past COVID and we need a lot of cheap energy to recover. There is no scenario where this won't happen, Oil, in general, is the most undervalued industry in the market right now, and its our drugs. 

I would stay away from companies who are very into US fracking, but for the rest you should be fine with anything in the industry.

Shell (RDS.A) is the one which looks the best for me. They cut dividends earlier this year which strengthened their balance sheet, it made institutions sell, but they are now increasing dividend again (they reported decent profit this week) and said they want to continue to increase it from now on. 

tl;dr: Calls RDSA 15-30% OTM 6 months out. Literally cant go tits up."

The company is allowing existing shareholders to sell up to one-fifth of their holdings now while hanging onto the rest until the lockup period expires after it reports results for the year ending Dec. 31.  “

Quote from: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/30/palantir-goes-public-pltr-starts-trading-on-the-nyse.html

Be aware of this lockup end and get ready to buy the dip. December 31st is the end of Q4 and when employees can release their locked shares. 

Edit: When PLTR reports their earnings this is when they can release their shares. The 31st is just the end of Q4. Pay attention around late December for earnings date.

GOOGL,IPOB merging with Open Door in $5B TEV transaction; Ark Funds Have Already Bought $50MM,1605385952.0,"Positions: 400 IPOB 5/21 20C and  19,500 IPOB-WT

OpenDoor has the potential to become the next meme stock. It is transforming the real estate market through simplifying a complex, costly, and long process to sell or buy a house into a simple process. Think Carvana but for your house. The market is massive – nearly $1.6 trillion annually and this company already has traction, booking nearly $5B in revenue in 2019 (with a dip in 2020 due to COVID) and ramping growth going forward. $3.5B in sales expected in 2021, $10B in 2023.

The company has a leadership team from all the well known, successful unicorns – Amazon, Trulia, Square, Netflix, AirBNB, Uber, Lyft, Google, FourSuqare, and well known institutions like TPG.

One of the most well known disruptive technology investors, Ark Funds (Cathie Wood, $20B AUM), has already invested in 3MM shares as of this past Friday, taking close to 10% of the publicly available float of IPOB. Ark was one of the earliest believers in TSLA and a number of other names. The Ark funds returns are best in class and it’s rare to see a megafund like this make such a large bet on a company that is 1) a SPAC and 2) hasn’t even merged yet.

When the combination is likely complete by end of year, this will allow other funds to invest and they will very much likely follow Cathie’s lead given her track record and reputation.

Zillow at 2.3x 2023 revenues, and Redfin at 2x 2023 revenues. Assuming Opendoor at 2x 2023 revenue would yield a share price of the following:

2x 2023 revenue x $10B = $20B TEV

Current TEV implied of \~$10B, so about 100% upside from today’s levels assuming no premium for the faster growth rate from Opendoor and much larger addressable market opportunity with the ibuying focus and infrastructure (nearly 60-65% share). With the merger coming, it will catapult shares higher with not many shares left to grab with Ark and others sucking them up.

So my GreatGma is 96 years old.  She's sharp as a tack, however she has her ""senior moments"" every now and then I reckon.

So a little background about myself.  I am the black sheep autist of the family.  I have 3 brothers, and my father is high political figure in my community.

My older brother Kyle is a doctor.  Married with Kids.

My younger brother George is an manager of a warehouse, he also is married with kids.

Then there's me, Greg, a 33 year old ex drug addict with 3 kids with 3 different moms.  I work for $12/hr at Chuck E Cheese,as the dress up mouse that dances for kids every hour and they make me make pizzas when its not my dancing hour.  And Cheryl is a cunt manager who gets mad at me for smoke breaks.

Anyways, I am driving my 96 year old great grandmother to Walden's Bookstore (that she keeps forgetting that amazon ran out of business 2 years ago) and also just spending some time with her looking for any open blockbusters so she can rent some vhs tapes.

She turns to me in the car and says ""GEORGE?!""

""No Grandma, its Greg, Not George""

""Right! That GREG! IS AN UTTER MESS, HE LIVES A SHATTERED LIFE.  I NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS, SUCH A TWISTED MESS!""

This is my first time posting a DD so bear ***(I hate bears..)*** with me! Everyone and their mom's boyfriends are talking about Weed weed weed.

The Pandemic has devastated so many industries but ***you know what has been absolutely booming??***

**Golf. Golf. Golf.**

Here are some statistics for 2020

&#x200B;

1. Google searches involving “golf balls” and “golf clubs” is the highest it’s been in 5 years
2. Shares of their competitor (Titleist) Acushnet Holdings (NYSE:[GOLF](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOLF)) was up 6.0% after earnings last Friday. 
3. U.S. golf equipment retail sales topped $1 billion in total for the months of July, August and September, an all-time high for a quarter since Golf Datatech started its tracking in 1997.
4. Q3 - Around 30 million+ more rounds played for this July, August, September compared to last year! Meaning July, August, and September all saw much more golf than last year.
5. Percent increase in rounds played in June year-over-year, according to Golf Datatech’s report. Because people tend to play a *lot* of golf in June in any year, this translated to 7-8 million more total rounds in 2020 than in 2019.
6. Dick’s reported same-store sales rose 20.7% during the second quarter, even with 15% of locations closed, on average, during the quarter. “The golf business has been great both at Dick’s and \[Golf\] Galaxy,” said Dick’s CEO Ed Stack on the company’s earnings conference call
7. 98% of Golf Courses are open

&#x200B;

*All of these analytics translates to = more golf equipment, more golf balls, more golf gear, more golf everything.*

I think ELY (Callaway) is incredibly undervalued at $17 with a market cap of 1.62 billion. **Not to mention, they just acquired Top Golf at a 50% discount.**  This will jump to $20-$22 after earnings with relatively low IV. *I was all over Upwork and made quite a bit off of it. This has a very similar feel.*

GOOGL,Parabolic SPAC time ft. EOSE,1605708653.0,"TLDR – EOSE May ’21 20c and shares if the MMs aren’t selling calls yet

The latest SPAC merger is Eos energy storage (EOSE) as of Monday. Why should you care about EOS?

Stationary energy storage to support the electricity grid is right on the cusp of going parabolic. Don’t take my word for it, check out Wood Mackenzie:  


https://preview.redd.it/oy98wvbxa0061.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=8439018d68d59d63ad883789bc684e5813d8bcd1

And you know what requires energy storage? Renewable energy like wind and solar when it produces power when people aren’t using it. How are renewable energy stocks doing?  Vestas makes wind turbines and they are up 93% YTD. First solar makes solar panels and they are up 43% YTD. These technologies need energy storage to continue their growth on the grid.

Biden says we are going to upgrade our infrastructure and do it in a clean way – that means green energy. Places like Texas and California already have so much wind and solar energy that they need storage in order to add more.

So why Eos:

\-Eos isn’t lithium ion like all of the other grid scale batteries. It uses zinc technology which is safe. What happens to unsafe technology like lithium ion? [They blow up](https://www.enr.com/articles/49809-utility-report-on-energy-storage-battery-blast-cites-equipment-flaw). Utilities don’t want this. They want a safe technology like zinc that cannot blow up.

\-It isn’t toxic. Lithium iron battery spill? Call it a superfund site. Eos’ electrolyte is non toxic.

GOOGL,Why cruise lines might dump in the near future,1605535680.0,"Cruise lines might dump before January, here’s why.

“So far a total of seven passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 aboard the SeaDream 1 cruise ship docked in Barbados, according to two passengers on the ship.” This was the first major cruise to try sailing with these new CDC guidelines and covid is being spread on the ship, as expected.

“A pair of Democratic Senators have sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control, appealing to the agency to reinstate its ‘no sail order’ that would prohibit cruises from sailing in U.S. waters during a current surge in COVID-19.”
There are already senators trying to make CDC reinstate the no sail order due to covid spikes.

Most major cruise lines plan on sailing in 2021 and are using this time to prepare their plan to follow CDC guidelines. But if the CDC determines they will reinstate the no sale order it will have to be before January to prevent cruise lines from sailing. There is also the political factor, that CDC might’ve lifted the ban under pressure from POTUS, but in January we’re getting a new one and he is the same party of the democratic senators applying pressure on the CDC to cancel cruising.

I think there’s a 50/50 chance this happens. And you retards love those odds. I have no relevant positions currently but wanted to give you guys a heads up because no one is talking about this and cruise lines are soaring on vaccine news

TLDR: CDC might reinstate no sail order before January. Cruise lines will tank if that happens. Buy cruise line puts expiring January if you wanna make a speculative bet.

GOOGL,"ADT, down 33% in 6 weeks. Earnings Report after hours on Thursday, Nov 5",1604369154.0,"Can somebody please convince me not to do this?! I feel like I’m taking CRAZY PILLS!!


So ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. 

Google bought a stake in them 3 months ago to acquire 6.7% of the company. Average price, $8.22. $450m worth of stock, pricing the company at a valuation of $6.7b. 

Current price, $6.70. Current valuation: $5.5b

Yes, GOOG is bagholding -18.5% on this. They have the option to acquire up to 9.99% of the company in total in the terms of their agreement.

The price shot from $8.50 to $17.00+ that day and spent a week or two selling off, down to something like $11-13.50 throughout the following days that ensued.

6 weeks after Google’s buy-in, there was a secondary public offering that then dropped the shares from $10.80 to $9.22 in a single day (-14% drop). Turns out it was the majority shareholder, Apollo Management, and they priced the shares at $10. Yes, ten dollars. The additional shares to market implied a dilution of 5.5% on the total float, yet the price dropped 15% likely because ADT was receiving no proceeds of the offering, by nature of it being an SPO by Apollo.

ADT $7.5c 11/20
  
ADT $10c 11/20

Earnings play. Thoughts??

TL;DR - ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. They are currently down 18.5% from when Google acquired 6.7% of their company three months ago. They are also down 33% from the price of their secondary public offering that was placed 6 weeks ago. Their last quarterly report was bullish on guidance.

Find the companies who bribed that beanpaste-faced toad and you know who's going to win the contracts.

Verizon is a shoe-in for the provider, it just needs to be confirmed. Manufacturer is harder to stick.

After that, just play the announcement date for the contracts, your calls will print guaranteed.

GOOGL,Ryan Cohen before he sold Chewy for $3 Bilion,1605628738.0,"Cross reference to other posts on Ryan Cohen’s public GME call out with this August 2020 Interview.

Paragraph that caught my eye and confirms my GME bullish bias

Friedman: You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from the process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?

Cohen: For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those “no”s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.

Most investors couldn’t get past two hurdles: competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble. But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high-touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. Pets.com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs. These two hurdles didn’t scare me. I never considered changing my business plan. One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he believed running into Amazon’s teeth was suicidal.

I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.

A lot of us here went all in on Rocket’s earnings report this past week. I was expecting a good report with solid forward looking guidance. Rocket beat all my expectations, and all of the analysts’ as well.

-Revenue up 163%
-EPS beat ($1.21 vs $1.07)
-$1 billion share buyback
-And more

I know that in this climate, fundamentals don’t matter, but it really seems that Rocket has NO reason to be such a stagnant stock. 

A lot of people on this sub like to call Rocket a meme stock, but this is the real deal. Personally, I will be buying more calls for December because I feel that the market has to realize RKTs value eventually. 

It seems that even the CEO is scratching his head following the reaction to the earnings report, according to the article I linked.

GOOGL,Future SPAC Trendy: GIK - LOI Expected to Drop This Week or Next 👀 👀,1605919488.0,"Sup my people,

Even though some of these EV companies are a total joke, I think we found a winner here. GIK and Lightning eMotors are in “advanced talks” regarding a funding deal. See the excerpt below for funding info and what Lightning does:

“Lightning eMotors has raised about $28 million and was valued at about $47 million after a March funding led by BP Ventures, according to PitchBook Data. It said at that time it would use the funding to ramp up production to fulfill new orders for electric powertrains for Ford Transits, Ford E-450s, Ford F-59 step vans, Chevrolet Low Cab Forward 6500XD trucks and Lightning Electric city buses.

The company in October said it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, increased production and doubled its workforce.”

The wave on this guy hasn’t come close to starting with volume only picking up yesterday. Traded sideways all day until after hours where it went up ~3%. As stated LOI is expected to drop within the next two weeks. Could be the next CIIG.

GOOGL,Reassessing $amzn and if it's a buy/hold at over $3000,1605457485.0,"I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.

I took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.

This is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:

1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 ""Bar Raisers"" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they ""Raise the Bar"" with each hire. 

2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. 

3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. 

4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.

Anyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?

Are you invested in $amzn and if so, what are your top reasons or Amazon businesses for continuing to hold or buy even more? Or alternatively, if you're not investing in $amzn why not? 

Will be interesting to get some varied perspectives, as Amazon is such a beast and a nevereneding topic."

GOOGL,Beyond doom and gloom: A nuanced discussion of multifamily rentals / REITs in very high cost of living cities (VCOL),1604275407.0,"Obligatory disclaimer: “predicting is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future”, and I’ve been very wrong before (most recently about the market rebound). But it’s fun to have a discussion and what else is there to do now that it’s cold with a COVID surge?  
&nbsp;

Full disclosure: Despite my arguments below, I hold modest positions in several of the apartment rental REITs. One reason is simply to hedge against me being wrong. I also think there’s a gap between the eventual modest decline in valuations and the 40-50% decline we’ve seen in luxury coastal apartment REITs (Essex, Avalon, Equity). The public REITs have investment grade credit rating, and several of them (Equity, Avalon) have recently issued debt at ~2% due to the accommodative corporate credit environment. Many also have suburban portfolios which could prosper from the urban departures. 

&nbsp;

# Intro 

There’s been a great deal of hysteria in the popular press / investment forums about “the death of cities”. 

This is clearly ridiculous. “Cities” are the engines of economic growth in every developed economy. The 100 largest metropolitan areas contain 65% of the US population and 68% of total economic activity (and closer to 75+% of patents, intellectual property development, etc). Cities as a whole will continue to grow and expand in the United States as they have for the past 200 years. 

On the flip side, not all cities are created equally. I think a very reasonable question to ask is how will the multifamily real estate markets in very high cost of living cities (VCOL), loosely defined as San Francisco, NYC, Boston, and maybe LA fare in the near future? 

I’m personally a big believer that external shocks very rarely generate new trends but tend to accelerate existing underlying ones. And when looking at the future of VCOL areas we have a story about demographics, affordability, schools / child care, job dispersion, supply, and immigration. 

&nbsp;

# Thesis 

My thesis is that VCOL, and in particular the dense urban cores, will see flat to negative growth in populations, rent, and condo prices as Millennials age into child-rearing years and move to areas with more affordable housing / better schools. Older generations will continue their preference for warmer, lower tax areas while foreign immigration remains depressed. This trend will be compounded by the increase in luxury rental units as projects initiated in 2018, 2019, and early 2020 move onto the market. More flexible work from home policies will also contribute modestly to this trend, but is not the main driver. Single family housing, even in VCOL areas, will likely be unaffected due to severe supply constraints. 

&nbsp;

I see Millennials primarily moving to 3 distinct areas of the country:

- Cheaper areas outside the urban core in Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), e.g. Worcester MA in the larger Boston metro area, suburban areas in NJ adjacent to NYC, etc. 
- Smaller, emerging high-tech cities such as Pittsburgh, Boise, etc. that offer relatively affordable housing, walkable communities, and often close proximity to national parks, ski areas, etc. 
- Sunbelt / Southern “mega-cities’ such as Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta, etc. with affordable housing and booming populations 

# What do the public markets say?

One of the features (not a bug) of private real estate is that it moves much more slowly and is oftentimes uncorrelated with public markets. Case in point, residential housing prices peaked in the US around 2006-2007 and then decreased until 2012 (i.e. 3-4 years after the stock market and other public markets fully reflected the valuation shifts). Luckily for today’s investors, one major difference between 2008 and today is that we have large, national, publicly traded REITs in both the apartment and single family rental sectors. Even better, the apartment housing REITs have different geographic concentrations and economic consumers (i.e. luxury, affordable, student, etc.). We also have large, publicly traded companies involved in single family home building / renovations that are also great proxies for the single family housing market. 

&nbsp;

So, how are apartment rental REITs in VCOL locations doing? The first one to consider is Essex Property Trust (ESS), a member of the S&P 500. They have luxury apartments primarily in LA & San Francisco (~75%) and also in Seattle (~25%). They are down ~40% from their all time high in February. Next up is Avalon Bay (AVB), the largest apartment REIT, which owns luxury apartments in VCOL coastal areas in Boston, NYC, SF, etc. They are down ~40% from their all time high. Equity Apartments, similar to AvalonBay but with a slightly worse credit rating of BBB+, is down ~50%. UDR, another coastal luxury apartment REIT, is also down ~40%. If you read the most recent earnings calls from Equity / Avalon, one thing they both cite is their high rental collection rate (~98%) and the high household income of their tenants (~$150,000). 

&nbsp;

Let’s contrast that to the sunbelt / mid Atlantic luxury REITs: Camden Property (CPT) and Mid America Apartments (MAA). These REITs have extensive holdings in Texas, Florida, Phoenix, etc. Mid America is down ~22% while Camden is down ~25%. 

&nbsp;

The market is currently discounting luxury apartment rentals in VCOL by almost 2x the rate as more affordable sunbelt / Southern cities. This is despite the fact that rental collection rates remain high and that these properties have affluent tenants who are least likely to be affected by the recession. 

&nbsp;

The contrast is even more stark when comparing against single family rental REITs, the largest of which is Invitation Homes (a spinoff of Blackstone, INVH). They own ~90,000 homes across the Sunbelt, upper mid-west, and more affordable areas of the West. They are down only 9% off of all time highs. The US home construction ETF from I-shares (ITB) which tracks home developers such as Lennox and home supply stores like Lowes actually set an all time high in September 2020. 

&nbsp;

The bottom line is that public markets suggest that luxury, apartment rental housing companies have lost 20-50% of their pre-pandemic value, with VCOL losing almost twice the value of luxury rentals in booming sunbelt / southern cities. In contrast, single family home rentals remain extremely strong with valuations of home building companies trading at all time highs. 

As an aside, if you’re bullish on VCOL areas I would strongly suggest purchasing these REITs. The dividend yields are ~4.5% which is the widest spread over 10 year treasuries (0.8%) in many years. If you listen to the earnings call from Equity, Avalon, etc. you’ll also hear the CEOs cite the high private market valuations of their properties. If the market is wrong you’ll lock in relatively high dividend rates with price appreciation. 


# Demographics 

Even before the pandemic, VCOL had stagnant or modestly declining populations. Government census records estimate that NYC lost ~76,000 residents in 2019, a drop of around 0.4%. It’s worth noting that NYC  has for years experienced net negative domestic migration, but foreign immigration balanced out the departures. The Boston metro region stayed flat while San Francisco declined slightly (~0.2%). While economically vibrant, the populations of these cities had clearly started to plateau and even modestly decline prior to the pandemic. There’s a nice graph at rent cafe that summarizes the metros with the highest and lowest net migration over the past decade. NYC and LA top the list, with Boston at the number 8 position. In contrast, the metros with the highest migration are Phoenix, Dallas, and Austin in the Top 5.  	

&nbsp;

If we look at the composition of these cities, the largest age bracket is from 25-44: 37.5% in San Francisco, 33.2% in Boston, and 33% NYC. This essentially encompasses the millennial generation, who the census defines are born between 1981 - 1997 (~23 to 39). The millennial cohort comprises ~75 million individuals and is the largest generation since the baby boomers and significantly larger than the next generation, Gen-Z. 

&nbsp;

The millennial cohort entered their mid-20s during and immediately after the Great Recession. Millennials with technical or advanced degrees flocked to the new “knowledge” jobs in tech, consulting, marketing, etc. at employers clustered in VCOL areas. With significant disposable income, these millennials fueled a rise in service industries that attracted other millennials to work as baristas, waiters, etc. At the same time, new single family home construction declined significantly due to the fallout from the housing bust. 

&nbsp;

As a consequence rents held relatively steady during the financial crisis than surged during the recovery. As one data point, rents increased ~50%+ from 2010 to 2019 in SF. As Millennials willingly paid rapidly rising rents in these VCOL, a narrative emerged that millennial were somehow different. They were comfortable renting forever, they didn’t need much space, they believed in the sharing economy and wouldn’t purchase cars, etc. The data appeared to support this data, as the number of renters earning $150,000 increased at twice the rate as home owners.  

&nbsp;

Unfortunately there is increasing evidence against this narrative. A linked MIT Sloan study suggests millennials may actually utilize vehicles more than older generations. The linked survey from ApartmentList suggests that over 90% of millennials want to own homes eventually. Millennials, based on all the studies and surveys I’ve seen, have similar aspirations as older generations. They want to eventually own, not rent, a residence and personal vehicle while raising children. All of these goals have simply been delayed due to financial constraints. 

As we’ll see in the next section, these aspirations are effectively impossible for the vast majority of millennials in VCOL areas. 

# Affordability:

There’s a popular stereotype that the average millennial is a 4 year college graduate, making $100,000+ in tech, who walks around in Patagonia vests sipping $5 lattes (fuller disclosure: this stereotype hits uncomfortable close to home). According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) only 44% of millennials even have 4 year or higher college degrees. Moreover, at age 39 (i.e. the oldest millennial), an income of $100,000 is in the top ~25% of incomes. The median net worth of the prime home buying aged millennial (30-34) is only $35,000 (including home equity), while the 90th percentile of this group is only ~$260,000 (including home equity). In 1989 (when baby boomers were the equivalent age of Millennials today) they held about 21% of the wealth in the US. In contrast, Millennials today have ~3%. 

&nbsp;

For the median millennia household, who has an income of ~$69,000 pre-pandemic, buying even a modest apartment in a VCOL is difficult to impossible without extensive family assistance. Let’s assume that most millennial households want to have at least 1 child (a Gallup poll found ~87% of millennials without children eventually wanted to have them). That means long term millennials are likely to settle in at least 2BR and more likely 3 BR and up apartments / homes. 

&nbsp;

The median priced condo (not house) in VCOL areas (pre-pandemic) is approximately  ~$1.2 million in SF,  ~$650,000 in Boston, and ~$667,900 in NYC (Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens). This understates the lack of affordability, because these prices reflect a mixture of studios to 3+ BRs. I couldn’t find detailed sales pricing for condos segmented by number of bedrooms, but glancing at Zillow / Redfin the prices for 3BR apartments or single family homes across all VCOL areas seems to be at least $800k and above depending on quality, location, etc. 

&nbsp;

Rents are luckily far more transparent. According to Zumper, the rents for 3BR apartments and above in VCOL (pre-pandemic) areas were ~$5,000 in SF, ~$3,500 in Boston, and ~$4,000 in NYC.  As an aside, if we use a 30% rent to income ratio than a millennial household would have to make at least $10,500 per month (or an annualized salary of $126,000) to rent a 3 BR in the cheapest VCOL area. For households with families in 2017 between 30-35, an income of $126,000 is at the 80th percentile. As we’ll see in the next section, childcare dramatically adds to a households costs. 

&nbsp;

So let’s focus our analysis on the wealthiest 10% of millennials (who coincidentally are also most likely to have affluent parents who can assist with a home down payment). These millennials, particularly those in the prime family formation years of 30-35, make over $170,000+. Given the well documented trend in associative mating, they are also likely to partner with other high income millennials. Let’s assume that ~5% of millennial households make  >$200,000 per year (for comparison, the top 10% of all households made over $200,000 in 2019). These households can easily afford even San Francisco rental prices. And at first glance, a millennial household making $200,000 could save for a downpayment of a $1 million dollar home (~$240,000) within ~6 years if they saved 20% of their gross income. But what about affording the monthly mortgage payment? 

&nbsp;

As rough numbers, a household making $200,000 in Boston, MA would be left with $148,712 after taxes. If they maxed out their 401k, they would have $121,135 or ~$10,000 per month. Redfin estimates that a $1 million home in Boston will cost ~$4500 a month based on a 3%, 30 year mortgage and including home insurance + property taxes. If we assume maintenance + furnishings + misc expenses we can probably assume a total housing cost of ~$5500 per month. Our hypothetical household is thus left with ~$4500 per month to spend on food, entertainment, vehicles costs, etc. while also maxing our their 401k. 

Let’s assume there are roughly 31 million households between 25-39, so back of the envelope math suggests that there is a pool of 1.5 million households available to buy real estate in VCOL areas (5% of 31 million) if they could afford the down payment or receive family assistance. 

There is one giant impediment to that math though: affordable childcare and public schools. 

# Child Care

The biggest single reason in my opinion that millennials will leave VCOL urban areas is the the cost of childcare (averaging $2000 per month)  and the persistent poor performance of public schools.  

&nbsp;

The premier public school districts continue to remain in the outer suburbs of urban areas. A list of the top 15 public school districts in America shows numerous school districts in suburbs surrounding Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia. In contrast, public school districts in dense urban areas often receive mediocre ratings. 

The simplest alternative to these urban public schools is to pay for private school. Private school tuitions in VCOL areas range widely between ~$25k and ~$70k per child. These means a family of 4 could easily pay $50k or more in combined tuition, on top of the $66k ($5500 monthly) in housing expenses noted above. These two expenses alone would effectively consume the entire after tax income of a household making $200,000 per year. 

&nbsp;

The crushing expense of childcare shows up in declining birth rates in VCOL. Since 2011, the number of babies born in NYC has declined 9%. San Francisco has the lowest share of children of any of the top 100 metros. Families with children older than 6 are in decline in high density urban areas. (There’s a great Atlantic article from Derek Thompson linked below) 

&nbsp;

The bottom line is that for all but the wealthiest ~5% of millennial households settling down and raising a family in a VCOL area is essentially unaffordable without significant tradeoffs or parental support. Buying a modest home in a VCOL area, sending your children to private school, funding your retirement, and owning a modest vehicle combined requires a household income of close to $300,000. 

&nbsp;

Before the hate mail begins, the key word in the sentence above is trade-offs. I’m well aware the maxing out a joint 401k is puts a household ahead of almost all other American families. Unlike some personal financial columnists, I’m in no way suggesting that earning $300,000 per year is close to poverty or any other nonsense like that. Clearly, earning $300,000 a year as a household is a rare privilege that lets you enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle. 

The point I’m making is that in a VCOL a $300,000 salary does not make you feel affluent. You’re still likely stressed about money, still having to save for years to afford a down payment, driving a modest vehicle, etc. Meanwhile, any of your friends who live in Austin, Denver, etc. are able to enjoy a more stereotypical upper middle class life. Not to mention that your friends who move to Boise, Pittsburgh, etc. likely feel flat out wealthy. 

&nbsp;

Taxes are also worth a passing mention. Households making $200,000 in salary, maxing out both partners 401k, pay ~$10k in state / local taxes in VCOL areas (LA, SF, NYC, Boston). It’s worth noting that RSUs, i.e. the bulk of employees compensation at Big Tech firms, are taxed as regular income. Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, and New Hampshire all have no income taxes and most have booming metropolitan areas. The recent tax law changes passed by President Trump have also compounded the situation by increasing the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples and capping the state and local tax deduction to $10k. 

# Job Dispersion:

As I mentioned above, the VCOL areas had stagnating or modestly declining populations even in 2019. In stark contrast, the sunbelt & Southern cities are booming. Austin, TX experienced a 2.8% population increase in 2019. Denver, CO experienced a 1.5% population increase. Boise, Idaho was the fastest growing city in the US over the past decade. Even Orlando, FL is growing at over 1% a year. 

&nbsp;

And employers are more than happy to open offices in lower cost, “business friendly” locations. Palantir announced its intention to shift to Denver, CO. Tesla plans to open up its Gigafactory near downtown Austin. Startup funding in Austin continues to rise (albeit from low levels).  

Even well established Silicon Valley offices have rapidly growing satellite offices in Austin, Denver, etc.  Facebook has 1200 employees in Austin (compared with ~15,000 in San Francisco). Google has > 1500 employees in Austin as well. Google also employs 1500 employees in Denver / 
Boulder. 

&nbsp;

Many of these regions are anchored on world class research universities as well. The University of Texas at Austin has top 10 computer science and engineering programs. Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh is a Top 5 computer science school and leader in Artificial Intelligence research.  The University of Minnesota has a top 2 Chemical Engineering program. 

&nbsp;

We unfortunately can’t discuss job dispersion without addressing the vociferous work from home debate. I frankly don’t think the pandemic will significantly impact the work from home trend long term. Many high paying sectors have already moved towards flexible work arrangements. Glancing at McKinsey’s website, we see that many of their positions list 20+ major metros as possible locations, including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, etc. Snowflake, the hottest company of 2020, lists 237 open positions on their website. Only 86 of those are in listed as San Mateo (their SF Bay Area headquarters), mostly in engineering / internal operations. The reason is obvious: over 125 positions (i.e. 55+%) are in customer facing roles in sales, professional services, etc. Companies want a geographic dispersion of these roles both across the US and internationally. 

&nbsp;

It’s also worth mentioning that “elite” companies, who provide a disproportionate number of the jobs for high income millennials, frankly don’t have that many employees. Alphabet and Facebook combined have only ~200,000 employees despite a market cap of approximately $2 trillion dollars. Bain & McKinsey combined only have ~30,000 employees. JP Morgan chase has 256,941 employees, but only 37,000 (14.4%) are in New York. The largest single office for JP Morgan is actually in Columbus, Ohio and houses 11,050 employees. 

We’re also seeing a bit of a “resource curse” for VCOL cities as the extremely high costs of living / business drive out firms who aren’t as profitable per employee. McKesson, #8 on the S&P 500 list by revenue, moved its HQ from San Francisco to Dallas in 2018. Charles Schwab, is leaving San Francisco while expanding its offices in Denver & Dallas. 

&nbsp;

The bottom line is that the trend was already clear pre-pandemic. The leading companies, who pay the highest salaries, are actively investing in satellite offices or remote positions across the United States. For tech and management consulting companies, this helps distribute their customer facing sales and service teams. For financial and other companies, they are able to lower their costs by moving back-office operations outside VCOL areas. Meanwhile, companies who aren’t able to match the compensation packages of elite firms or want to lower their cost of business are relocating to cheaper areas. 

As a final point, Forbes has an interesting article about the top 15 metro areas ranked by revenue of Fortune 500 companies headquartered there. While the New York metro area dominates the list with 65 companies that earn $1.7 trillion in revenue, and the greater SF / San Jose area is second with ~$1.5 trillion, the next 2 spots are Dallas ($996.2 billion) and Chicago ($842.2). Minneapolis and Houston also are in the top 7 spots, above either Boston or Washington DC. 

# Supply:

Concerns about multifamily supply had already started in mid 2019. Years of low interest rates and strong rental price growth had led to dramatic booms in apartment housing. Fannie Mae (the government agency) has detailed insights into the multi-family market across major metros. Helpfully they also include rent growth predictions from 3 large real estate analytics companies.  

&nbsp;

The Boston, MA core urban area had a projected ~10,000 units in the pipeline for 2020 (estimated at 4-6% new supply).  Rent price increases were estimated at average of 2% and trending downward pre-pandemic.San Francisco had planned delivery of ~5,000 new unites in 2019 and 2020 with a projected increase in vacancy rate of 5% (trending towards balanced). New York City already had a glut of luxury apartments in 2019, with stagnant or negative rent growth projected pre-pandemic. 

It’s worth noting that while single family home construction has continued to lag demand, multi-family home construction rebounded to pre Great Financial Crisis levels by 2013. By 2015, multifamily construction had hit the highest level since 1987. 

&nbsp;

We can see the effect of supply in the fact that average rental prices in several VCOL had started to plateau around late 2018. Boston, MA saw rental price growth of only ~2-3% annually between 2016 and 2019 according to RentCafe. RentCafe also shows San Francisco average rents increasing from $3450 in Nov 2016 to $3683 in Nov 2019, for an annual increase of 2-3% as well. Brooklyn, NY average rents increased from $2603 in Nov 2016 to $2928 in Nov 2019 for a total increase of 12% or ~4% per year. One thing to keep in mind is that these average rents don’t take into account hedonistic adjustments, i.e. people moving into nicer, new luxury apartments and paying slightly more. 

# Immigration / Baby Boomers / Gen Z:

With evidence pointing towards a modest decline in the number of millennials in VCOL areas, could other groups offset their departure? What about foreign immigrants? 

&nbsp;

Regardless of your thoughts on the Trump administration, it’s clear the administration has kept its promise to reduce foreign immigration into the United States. In 2018, the New York Times reported that net immigration to the US was only 200,000, the lowest level since the Great Recession. The same article, along with a related article from PBS also notes in particular that Chinese student attendance has dropped significantly due to concerns over visas, geo-political tensions, and violence. The current pandemic and recent trade tensions are likely to only exacerbate the situation. The Department of Homeland Security websites shows that “Persons obtaining lawful residence in the US” dropped by ~150,000 between 2016 and 2019 (or ~10%). This is a problem for VCOL which have relied upon foreign immigration to make up for net domestic migration. Foreign investment has often followed this migration. 

At the moment, there also isn’t an obvious political constituency to argue for increased legal immigration into the US. The Democratic Party’s immigration policy is largely focused on legalizing the Dreamers, i.e. children born to undocumented immigrants. The Republican Party’s immigration policy has largely focused around halting illegal immigration.

&nbsp; 

What about baby boomers returning to the cities for their golden years? The New York Times cites census data which indicates that 17.8% of 54-72 year olds live in urban areas (defined by density). This compares with 21.6% in 1990. Moreover, while more baby boomers are renting, they seem to prefer to do so in suburban areas. 

&nbsp;

Well, what about Gen Z (those born after between 1997- 2012)? First of all, the generation is smaller than millennials by about 5 million individuals. Second, a Pew research study has found that for the oldest Gen Zers (18-23), over 50% have reported that they or someone in their household has lost a job or pay in the recent recession compared to 40% of millennials and only 25% of Baby Boomers. Last, but likely most important, the millennials successfully revitalized and then gentrified large parts of the VCOL urban cores. As a consequence, to borrow a phrase, the rents are already too damn high. Gen Z will enter the workforce already facing sky high rents in VCOL while dealing with a weaker labor market due to the COVID induced recession. 

&nbsp;

The bottom line is that there is no obvious group to replace the millennials if they start exiting core VCOL urban cores in large numbers. 


# Final Thoughts:

Whew, if you made it this far congratulations! I started writing this as a way to organize my thoughts, then frankly became fascinated in the topic. 

If I were to summarize this article, I would say “demographics is destiny” or “the pandemic accelerates, but does not change, existing trends”.  The 2010s saw the largest generation since the Baby Boomers delay the traditional milestones of adulthood to focus on their careers, education, and finances. Millennials preference for dense, walkable urban areas with deep job markets led to the urban renaissances of VCOL areas and accompanying spike in rents. A boom in multifamily construction followed as real estate developers rushed to deliver luxury rental apartments to cater to this new class of affluent urban dwellers. 

&nbsp;

The 2020s will see VCOL areas deals with the consequences of their success. Most millennials simply cannot afford to raise families in VCOL areas. Even before the pandemic we saw net migration increasing out of VCOL towards the booming Southern / Southwestern areas of the country. Companies are more than willing to follow suit, either by moving directly or by opening satellite officers to take advantage of cheaper real estate and lower taxes. Unfortunately this increase in departures is occurring exactly as multifamily supply continues to increase in VCOL areas due to a multiyear boom in construction. And there is no evidence that I've seen of any other demographic group who will rush to fill the vacancies generated by millennials. Baby boomers continue to prefer warm, low tax, suburban areas. Foreign immigration is depressed and likely to remain so for a variety of factors. Gen Z, with ~5 million fewer members than the millennials,  is graduating into a depressed labor market with rents already inflated far past what the median salary can afford. 

&nbsp;

I want to emphasize that this is a modest shift in population, not a panicked flight. A number of affluent millennials will continue to reside in VCOL areas and even purchase long term residences (particularly with parental aid). Millennials who were able to buy in 2012-2014 have enjoyed significant real estate appreciation and are also likely to remain in those areas. But these modest population decreases will lead to a flat to negative rent price growth in VCOL areas as the market struggles to absorb additional luxury supply. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, as has been a recurring theme during this pandemic, the pain will be felt most acutely by small-scale landlords who bought properties recently in VCOL areas. Residential Real Estate is in some ways a zero sum game in that each tenant can usually only occupy one unit at a time. The large, publicly traded coastal REITs are currently tapping the corporate credit markets to push out their existing debt maturities and raise additional capital at historically low rates. They can, and are, offering deep concessions for their luxury units to attract tenants. They also typically have diversified into suburban areas and can invest opportunistically into high growth areas (notably Denver). They also have historically attracted the more affluent tenants who are willing to pay a premium for amenities (concierage, gyms, etc.) and are least affected by the pandemic. 

&nbsp;

To end on a positive note, I think the migration of millennials to more affordable, emerging cities is a net positive for the United States. Entrepreneurship, measured by small business formation in the US, has been dropping for years. I think part of the problem is that millennials in VCOL are locked into high paying career paths to afford rent, childcare, etc. Likewise spreading economic growth across the country and revitalizing other areas of the US may help bridge some of the bitter partisan politics.

Schrödinger only recently IPO-ed. so let's look at [their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490978/000119312520005504/d766269ds1.htm). Their software platform is currently being used by all of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, and the company is seeing increasing usage, as reported in their [most recent Q2 earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/10/schrodinger-inc-sdgr-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx). The most important part of the S-1, however, is this:

>We also leverage our platform and capabilities across a portfolio of collaborative and wholly-owned drug discovery programs spanning a wide range of disease targets and indications. We are currently collaborating on more than 25 drug discovery programs with more than ten different biopharmaceutical companies, including a number of companies we co-founded. These collaborations generate drug discovery revenue, including research funding payments, and discovery and development milestones, and have the potential to produce additional milestone payments, option fees, and future royalties. Furthermore, since mid-2018, we have launched five internal, wholly-owned programs. We are leveraging our computational platform with the goal of rapidly advancing the discovery of best-in-class and first-in-class therapies. Our current programs are focused on discovering and developing inhibitors for targets in DNA damage response pathways and genetically defined cancers.

My god, that gets me hard. SDGR's software revenue will soon be insignificant compared to the royalties and payments it collects from its partnerships. Let's dig deeper into this.

**Nimbus Therapeutics Already Sets a Precedent**

Nimbus Therapeutics was co-founded by Schrodinger, and similarly leverages computational chemistry to speed up the drug discovery process. Check out their website: [https://www.nimbustx.com/approach/](https://www.nimbustx.com/approach/)

If you want any more affirmation about the value of this technology, Nimbus sold their lead drug candidate for the treatment of NASH (basically, a disease that results from fat build-up in the liver) to Gilead Sciences for $1.2B. Read [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160404005324/en/Gilead-Sciences-Announces-Acquisition-Nimbus-Therapeutics%E2%80%99-Acetyl-CoA) for more information on that. In it, they mention that Nimbus used Schrödinger's platform to develop the drug candidate. And yes, SDGR received royalties for that deal.

&#x200B;

**SDGR is legitimately the puppet master pulling the strings for all of these companies. After all, many of them were founded by Schrödinger. Just look at this slide from their investor deck.**

>""As part of our ongoing efforts to deepen our software solutions for materials science applications, we entered into a three-year agreement in June with Gates Ventures to develop and apply novel, accurate atomistic simulation methods to improve battery performance.""

Papa Musk recently noted at Tesla's Battery Day that improvements to battery tech will most likely come from advancements in materials science. Read all of that [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/tesla-claims-it-can-drive-battery-costs-down-even-lower-with-new-material-science-innovations/). SDGR's already seen success applying its platform to drug discovery; who says they can't see similar success applying those methods to materials science? YOLO.

Yes, you saw it right!
CDC declared level 4 for cruise ship. The highest level, it’s like you have a trip to Iraq and fight with ISIS. 

Vaccines for emergency only. Do ya think they accept cruise ship for emergencies??? 🤷‍♀️

20 mils vaccine until end of Dec. 
Ship wont go sea until April. CCL already take more loans for themselves and reduce 20% of their ship.



On Friday, we saw CCL, RCL, NCLH drops pretty much. 

So you have the code:

11/27 CCL 16p 
NCLH 18p

It’s pretty cheap atm. 

I bought 15 contracts CCL for fcking 240$. It have potential for 1000$ print. Why not ? 

Remember the time CCL jump 30% to 19.6$ ??? It dropped to 14.93 within 3 days. 

So why not 16$ p ?? It’s just 1.5 $ from now. 

On Monday, it will even more cheap if u get the right time.

Did GME write crazy ITM puts because they're undervalued, bullish af, and increasing value for all of us long with them?

At first I thought the theory was stupid because the puts were written so deep ITM that there would be far too much risk.

GOOGL,Citron Research: what else have they called?,1605372727.0,"Everyone has heard about citrons stance on NIO at this point. And you may have seen posts about citrons past calls that makes them look like idiots. Jumia, Shopify, and Facebook are the calls most people focus on. 2 from 2016 one from 2019. The obvious issue there? There were a lot of calls made in that 3 year gap. Cherry picking their biggest losers is something you could do with any investment house considering they make 100s of price targets a year. So in the spirit of fairness I’ve put together some of their winners to show they aren’t as brain dead as some might want you to believe.

HMNY- only those that were too young to be around at the time don’t know about Moviepass. I’ll be honest. I was young and dumber and holding HMNY at this time and I was so fucking pissed when citron posted this story. But now look at the stock price. You’d struggle to even find it since they switch tickers and have reverse split the stock into the ground. Still citron called it and if you listened to them you wouldn’t have a -99.99% position in your account.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/10173237

Jumia- yes one of the companies that you thought was a bad call from them was actually good if you look at what their actual price targets were. Look at jumias chart. Citron shorted them after their IPO at $50 then it dropped to $2. 2 fucking dollars. Are you telling me shorting the stock wouldn’t have made money? After the stock had lost 90% of its value and changed the board heavily. Citron changed its call to bullish. Jumia was no longer overvalued and had fixed its internal issues citron saw. So their stance changed.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/18061798

Valeant- in 2015 valeants stock price was in the $200. Citron ran a story calling them out for inflating drug prices to cook the books. Giving them a PT of $20. A year later their stock had tumbled down to $20 after several investigations were opened.

In 2015 the Wall Street journal investigated citrons previous shorts and found that on average the first year after a citron call companies dropped 42%. So basically you could get mad at them or you could get rich from them. Your choice"
GOOGL,"$BABA - Jack Ma, Singles Day, Alibaba, Ants Financial",1605116208.0,"Who is telling the truth?

See news in Chinese for context -- it sounded really ugly.

&#x200B;

1. Yahoo etc say ""Alibaba Singles Day Sales (aka 11:11, Nov 11) Hit Record High $75 Billion""

Really? Check this out...

""Worst Nov 11 (China's equivalent of ""Prime Day/Black Friday"") in history: Jack Ma & buddies LOST $2 trillion in 2 days"" [https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml) ... Google for more (in Chinese of course). *NB: Yahoo and Wall Street have a stake in Alibaba?*

Google using Chinese characters 马云 =  Jack Ma = Mǎ Yún (马云)

Keypoint: Authority deliberately imposed many restrictions on labeling and  what can be sold on Alibaba's Taobao on Nov 11... To understand this strategy, read ""China tightens restrictions on Australian exports"" [https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537) ... same thing.

2. You must have heard of ""China drafts new antitrust guideline to rein in tech giants"" by now. What's the big deal? US and the west did the same thing, nothing happened.

Well, you must have forgotten conviction rate in China is literally 99.99%. That's the difference.

3. Ant Financials IPO - The politics behind the suspension isn't something Joe can understand.

First, the timing - why IPO suspended on the eve of the debut? This is directly due to the 5th China Communist Party plenum that ended just before Jack Ma & co were told their $3 trillion Ant Financials IPO was suspended.

Clue: No heir apparent as Xi Jinping reveals top leadership.

Still wondering what's happening? Here > The Boss wanna make sure all parties are obsessed with the world's largest IPO, happy, and create no trouble during the party plenum, which is the ""Bilderberg"" of China that may give birth to China's new leader (*against Xi Jinping who wanna rule forever*)

Second, non-bank money-lending is considered loan-sharking no matter how hard you try masqurade the sin as ""fintech"" -- no different from trying to bypass the Fed with any other form of money (just google what happened to those who tried...). This is not to say China is shutting down Ant Financials becos Jack Ma created a new cryptocurrency, it's becos Ant's microlending is seen as a timebomb for CCP.

How so? Google keywords like ""China P2P Lending Suicide Scandal"", you'd see why did China cracked down the so called hitech ""P2P Lending"" industry that left behind nothing good except social ills like suicides, bankruptcies, etc (many still listed as pennystocks on NASDAQ like KXIN, WEI, etc. -- all were given 2 years to wind down and do something else)... Ant Financials is no difference for CCP believes Jack Ma & co. will leave behind the same mess so big that it may collapse the CCP.

You see?

Plus, big-mouthed Jack Ma actually told this guy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang\_Qishan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qishan) that China regulators are dinosaur that neither understand nor capable of regulating ""fintech"".

tl;dr: Jack Ma is history -- He has been personally targeted to send out a clear message: ""Who's The Boss"" (just like why Trump fired Esper the other day). ""Xi Jinping going after Jack Ma's head"" [https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876](https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876)

GOOGL,You can forget about investing in Cincinnati Bell,1604984301.0,"Hey guys, first time posting here. I’m a student and for one of my classes we have to perform ratio, strategy, and accounting analysis on a company given to us. Thought I’d post it here so I can get some sweet karma in addition to a B+

So I’ve spent the last week combing a decade of Cincinnati Bell’s (CBB) previous 10k’s, reading any news article I could get my hands on, recasting, and doing SWOT and Porters Five analyses on CBB. 
Needless to say I think I know more about them than any other redditor on here (not true, but the lack of sleep and copious amounts of adderall tell me I’m right). I can say that this telecommunications company is headed nowhere fast. 

For one, they have an accumulated deficit of ($140 million) on their balance sheet that management seems to not give a shit about, as it’s been increasing steadily since at least 2011. They lag way behind the industry in liquidity (current ratio of .74) and haven’t turned a profit since 2017. They have a jaw dropping amount of debt (~2 billion), but I can’t even compute a D/E ratio because of their accumulated deficit. 

ROA? About .3 behind the rest of the industry. Asset Turnover? Not much better. Verizon accounts for almost a quarter of CBBs receivables as well, so fingers crossed nothing bad happens to one of their biggest competitors.

But the whopper is their interest coverage ratio. IT’S .6. Their EBIT only covers 60% of their interest needs  each year. Unless I’m missing something, this is a recipe for perpetual debt and eventually bankruptcy. 

Apart from the numbers, they’ve put all (or most) of the geographical eggs in one basket. They service a depressed part of a rust belt state that people are leaving in droves. They did acquire Hawaiian Telecom in 2018. Not that the revenue from that acquisition has exceeded the costs of integration yet. Hurray for another 1 million potential customers I guess. (Not mentioning that a single F5 or typhoon could wipe out half their infrastructure.)

Competitors? One of them is probably providing the data allowing you to read this post. They’re big, can spend wayyyyy more on PP & E, and have wireless divisions, unlike CBB.

Credit where it’s due: CBB honestly made a valiant effort to get into the fiber optics game back In the 2000s but it was too little too late; there’s no way they can compete with Google, AT&T, and Verizon’s expenditures on fiber cable. 

One more thing guys: 

CBB earns a fifth of its revenue from landline services. If you’re wondering if that’s a good thing or not try to remember the last time you used a god damn landline.

I could continue to trash Cincy Bell for a few thousand more words but I’m tired and want to smoke a bowl and hit the sack. If u want a full report email my professor lol. If I haven’t convinced you yet then you’re either my grandpa who still owns dusty Bell Telephone shares or are smarter than me, in which case buy that shit and pm me a few years from now to let me know how it went. 

TL;DR: grab your landline, call your broker, tell him to sell your CBB.


Edit: Forgot to mention that CBB was acquired by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners earlier this year. It’s an Australian investment management firm. Feel free to do your own DD on them."

**The Fuck’s a Browning Slope?**

A Browning Slope is a nerdy complicated math thing that I won’t explain because you don’t actually care and won’t understand it anyway. What matters, and what you should care about, is that when these typically innocuous events are followed by a few sideways or slightly red weeks (what I call a “Slight Slide”) they start to indicate the market is setting up a pretty damn bullish scenario. 

When we see *two* of these Browning Slope + Slight Slide cycles *within a 3 month window* they are almost *always* followed by a nice solid growth period lasting a few months. How can I be so sure? Well, guess what dingus? IT ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE THIS YEAR. After the 'Rona crash we saw two of these cycles and the July/August rally came right after. I drew a picture for those of you who ate the scratch n sniff books as a kid:

**What does it mean for me today?**  
It means we are currently 3/4 of the way through the setup to a bull’s dream. If another Slight Slide happens, we should be on the train to Tendie Town. Now, if you’ve made it this far you might have actually done a little bit of your own research and Googled “Browning Slope” and realized it’s just that: BS. I made it up. Anyone can draw red and green lines connecting candles and claim it’s a crystal ball. But it’s not. It’s a bunch of horse shit. These people are predicting all sort of events and they’ll *eventually* be right but like my deaf uncle says “Even a blind squirrel nuts every once in a while.” The truth is that no one really knows what is going to happen next until it's already happening. And anyone claiming they do is usually trying to sell you something, like VZ FDs.

GOOGL,Suncor Massive Upside,1605979364.0,"TLDR; forget boomer stocks, forget oil. Be in before your dumb biased friends

Warren Buffet owns it. He bought more during the 2020 crash. Saudi Arabia’s fund even bought Suncor, not Canadian oil stocks, Suncor specifically (google that suckers!). Suncor has massive potential.

Most don’t realize. But oil’s supply-side has taken a worse hit than demand. We always hear in the news “oil demand dropped! Oil demand this and that!” In reality, these oil producers stopped producing and now there’s a supply shortage.

Suncor is best positioned. They are the most efficient oil company in terms of process, and cost. In Canada, they are easily the most efficiently run company.

They have hidden value on their assets. Look at their Refining and Marketing. R&M alone puts their valuation higher than where the stock’s trading at.

*Skip this paragraph if you want, not necessary But if you wanna blow people’s minds, understand what I’m about to say.* The reason Suncor’s R&M business segment has hidden value is because it’s made up of refineries purchased a very long time ago. Under IFRS (and GAAP too) companies are not allowed to value a property higher than what they bought it for. Doesn’t matter if it’s worth 2x or 100x from where the company bought it. Suncor’s refineries are old. They are included in their ‘book value’ at net $9 billion (look up their statements, go to business segments and look for Refining and Marketing). So $9Bn on the books. They have 4 refineries. A SIGNLE REFINERY costs at minimum $10 BILLION to build in Canada. Suncor has 4 included in their R&M assets. So already, that $9Bn on their books is actually like $40bn. (That doesn’t include all the gas stations they own which is also included in that $9Bn, crazy I know.) But wait it gets better. In Canada, a refinery is worth wayyy more than just the metal it’s built from. Canada is highly regulated and almost impossible to build a new refinery. That means getting your hands on one in Canada is extremely important. It opens you up to a highly exclusive market. So remember that $40Bn we came up with? Imagine if Suncor wanted to sell those. Do you think they’d go for $40Bn in a market that’s next to impossible to penetrate? No. What would happen is every oil company in the world would say “wait Suncor is offering their Canada refineries, wtf! ?” Then they’d bid on them. And they wouldn’t pay $10Bn for 1. They’d bid those things to the moon. Picture what Exxon could accomplish with those refineries. It wouldn’t just be worth the building to Exxon, it would be worth adding to Exxon’s huge integrated network. And now in Canada? Wow. It seems like these refineries would go for way more. In fact each one is worth closer $30Bn. But guess what, Suncor isn’t gonna sell them because they know how much these refineries make.

How can you value these for sure and brag to your buddies? Well these refineries actually make around $3Bn in profits every year - check their statements and look at their average R&M earnings. If the average company is looking for a return of 5% on a new asset. These R&M assets are actually $60Bn ($3Bn / 5%). But that’s the average asset with an average company. What about an exclusive, almost impossible to penetrate market such as Canada? What if Exxon was looking to buy Suncor’s R&M assets? Well in this exclusive market, these discount rates aren’t 5%. They’re more like 2.5%, 1% or even <0.5%. The reason is because the value an acquirer adds to their business is worth far more than $3Bn that is currently produced every year.


Why are they so damn cheap? The problem is there was a one-two punch earlier this year. The OPEC supply war combined with a sharp drop in demand from government lockdowns. That combined with an already overall negative social sentiment toward oil meant quick sell offs. Funds were forced to sell for many reasons. Funds getting margin calls. On the debt side there are momentum funds having problems with oil & gas computer modelling. On the equity side, funds of every type are getting redemptions. A huge amount of what's going on is forced selling.

All of that meant a cheap price. Suncor is best positioned for a run up. Just ask Buffet or the f’ing Crown Price of Saudi Arabia!! Yes, please google that. They literally bought Suncor shares specifically.

The catalysts are of course vaccine talks. The recovery of demand. Supply shortage. But value alone is the biggest catalyst. If you do good valuation work, you will be rewarded."

FB,"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",1605451463.0,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

FB,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why,1605176800.0," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say."

Tattooed Chef is a young plant based food company that became publicaly listed few mouths ago via SPAC. The company was established in 2018 and has been rapidly growing ever since. In the first half of 2019 they reported 33mil in sales, and  a 104% increase raised the revenue to 67 mil in the first half of 2020. Their investors presentation looks pretty promising (google ""tattooed chef investor presentation"" first link). From their 10-Q you can see that from 2019 to 2020 they burned 1 billion of cash in hand, which is normally a good sign of heavy investments.
My logic behind it is that it is pretty immune to Covid-19.
1. With restaurants being closed and people staying at home will only increase their sales. 
2. People are exercising a lot less during this pandemic and an alternative to a half an hour jog or 20 pushups is to buy a cauliflower pizza instead. 
3. People have too much free time and are oftenwatching neflix documentaries. Two of the top 20 documentaries rn are about healthy diet and how vegan saves lifes (What the health and The game Changer (you have a couple more)), which is backed up by a lot of facts. So this will also encourage people to eat healthy. 
4. I read the reviews at walmart and their FB page and are nothing but good!! Only reason couple of people are complaining, is because it is expensive and corona won't have a major effect because most people who can afford their products on regular basis still have a job or are back to work. 
5. Their earning call is coming in on the 11.9, which in my oppinion will be pretty good.
6. Mark Cuban showed interest for TTCF in one of his tweets last week. 

Do your own DD and give me your oppinion. What is you target price in few years? 

From a techincal perspective I think that the trend is now turned upward and that 16.55 two days ago was the lowest.
I know that some articles might say that p/e is insane, but they are not taking in to account the growth and the trendiness of the stock

FB,4 potential bigly earnings plays (Bull and Bear cases),1603857495.0,"The four of these will probably have some massive swing post earnings. If you play these you better bet on the winning side. I have no positions in any of these (yet), but will probably make a play based on the how the market reacts tomorrow. I'm leaning towards TWTR puts. 

ATVI: Bull Case: Will beat estimates. Forward guidance will be great considering new console releases and Christmas. Winner of election does not have a big impact. Trading below ATH and trading below price from previous earnings. Has been consolidated for a while and no pre-earnings run up. Free advertising in forms of celebrity streamers playing ATVI games is underappreciated. 

Bear Case: Last earnings beat but was a buy the rumor sell the news ordeal. Do investors feel safe putting their cash in ATVI during these times? ATVI has burned lots of people who played their earnings. 

ETSY: Bull Case: Has been consistently green in this massive sea of red. Profitable for 4 consecutive quarters with a recent S&P inclusion. Advertising revenue should be up bigly. Etsy does a great job of retaining first time customers. COVID cases and potential lock downs help ETSY. Christmas around the corner.

Bear Case: No stimulus which impacts this non-essential business+. Lots of competition. Big run up post SNAP earnings largely in part of surprise ad revenue from SNAP earnings. This could very well be priced in and a beat could still result in a sell off. Large part of business was mask sales. IV very high and estimated EPS high

TWTR: Bull Case: Increased users that will continue due to elections. Could have a major gap up like SNAP in large part of unexpected ad revenue. Potential for 10+ bagger.

Bear Case: Trading at ATH. Growing at a much slower rate in terms of Y/Y revenue and profitability versus its competitors (FB, SNAP, etc.) Lots of controversy this quarter. An insane run up to earnings. Expectations very high because of SNAP. Last quarter was atrocious. Expectations are a big increase in ad revenue. TWTR struggles with ad revenue in large part because it is a more text-heavy platform in a social media world dominated by visual ads. Not too profitable and operating at a loss. 

SQ: Gapped up on previous 4 earnings (feel free to fact check me this may be incorrect). Purchase of $50 mil in shitcoin and may offer crypton payments like PYPL. Has an edge on the younger demographics. Approved for bank opening in 2021. Cash app is very profitable (23% of revenue is profit) . Cash app is 62% of revenue. Price to sales lower than PYPL and V. Nice dip for good entry. Earnings not priced in (yet). SQ Card readers are a hot item with a big profit margin.

Bear Case: Competition from PYPL and Chase who just entered this market. Sort of a one trick pony that relies too much on revenue from Cash App. Already up 150% on the year. Do investors trust Jack Dorsey long term?

TL:DR: ATVI calls, ETSY is a coin flip, TWTR puts, SQ calls

\*Disclaimer\* I have no positions in any of these. Just some quick analysis for a potential play. All depends on how the market reacts tomorrow. I'd stay away from TWTR unless you're buying puts."
FB,"Peter Thiel, Palantir (PLTR), and the long con that is social media",1604965443.0,"Thesis: Peter Thiel backed Facebook, not because it would become this powerful advertising D2C tool, but because it would become so powerful, and so difficult to regulate that governments would pay anything to be able to reign it in.

Assumption #1: Facebook didn’t enter advertising to monetize their platform, they did it to create an economy to incentivize better predictions and analysis of user data

Assumption #2: Any private entity that outruns the US government in terms of technology would instantly be demonized by both sides of the policy spectrum 

Assumption #3: governments will pay the private sector anything to topple enemies of public interest since they can essentially print money.

Everyone is talking about PLTR will become this backbone for cyber defence, but the most pressing public issue is how FAANG companies have inelastic leverage over our data. This morning I realized that Peter Thiel may have foresaw this whole time, and built the tool to arm governments to fight them while simultaneously been backing Facebook.

Call me crazy, but Thiele used both FB and PLTR to help elect trump and destabilize the US for the last 4 years, call me crazy but that sounds like how the US destabilized South America 

Maybe we’re all lead to believe billionaires want to live on private islands, so we don’t notice their buying up the ground we currently stand on

FB,"TTCF, big growth. Listed on NASDAQ since June. Not famous yet (I hope)",1604596298.0," Not a serious DD , this is more of a simple folks analysis. I will be posting a fundamental analysis next week and you can have a taste of the techinical on the bottom of this post. Please do not comment about the name of the comapny, obviously it is working out fine for them.

 So yesterday I bought TTCF. Why? Because it is a sexy stock with a huge growth.The comapny was founded in 2018 so many of you vegans out there have never heard about it. It went public a couple of mounts ago via SPAC and is now trading at 18$. Last year first half of 2019 they had 33 mil in sales and this year they had 67 mil. Revenue for 2021 is estimated to be 2.2X. Their investors presentation is pretty amazing and you can check it out down in the link.  My logic behind it is that it is pretty immune to Covid-19.

4. I read the reviews at walmart and their FB page and are nothing but good!! Only reason people are bitching about it is because it is expensive and corona won't have a major effect because most people who can afford their products on regular basis still have a job or are back to work.  

5. Their earning call is coming in on the 11.9, which in my oppinion will be pretty good. 6. Mark Cuban showed interest for TTCF in one of his tweets last week.   Call me a retard but these are some valid points. I know it is not a techinal or fundemental analysis but..... u know simple farm logic.  From a techincal perspective I think that the trend is now turned upward and that 16.55 two days ago was the lowest. I know that some articles might say that p/e is insane, but they are not taking in to account the growth and the sexyness.  Now lets just hope that sleepy doen t do anything stupid and makes the whole market go crazy (in a bad way).   Good luck trading 📷

FB,Conflicted On Twitter Heading Into Earnings,1603851571.0,"**TL;DR:**  Twitter has a horrible execution history and negative surprises on the most recent earnings call, but company has real long term value that has yet to be unlocked.   The bet here is that TWTR has run up based on pin action from SNAP, but fundamentals and peer comparison cloud the picture.

I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj3o2s/twitter_a_bird_in_a_bloodbath/) calling for a short on Twitter and it became a bit of a WSB ear worm.  I generally agreed with OP's assessment, but he was a bit short on DD and most of my thoughts are based on biases against the company's horrible execution/monetization history and a general disdain for Jack Dorsey wanting to move to Africa for a year rather than focusing on the TWO companies that have made him a billionaire.

I thought about it, researched some short term puts (high premium as expected given recent run up into all time high today, earnings Thursday) and basically ATM puts are running $2.76 for $51's expiring Friday or $3.36 if I want to give myself the extra week (ELECTION MADNESS!) for an extra swing at the payoff.

My initial thought is that Twitter has run up with SNAP and PINS after SNAP crushed earnings.  I had started to look at PINS for an earnings play but didn't get to it before SNAP sent them all (and FB) off to the races.  With that said, Twitter has a history of disappointing and I'm not aware of anything they've done recently to better monetize the site.  I also haven't done any DD on them in forever after getting stuck long a few times and having to wait a quarter or so twice for what should have been a short term trade.

So, thanks to [OP Justaryns,](https://www.reddit.com/user/Justaryns/) here's some follow on DD.   Now I'm more conflicted.

[Financials.](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR&qsearchterm=twtr&tab=financials)

Strong balance sheet.  Company had $7.8 Billion cash on hand end of June, adding $1 Billion of that during the first six (crash/shutdown) months of the year.  Only $831 Million of current liabilities and total debt is $4.1 Billion.    Market Cap is less than 4x book value.  No issues here.

Income statement is a bit more hokey.  They took a major charge last quarter for a ""[non-cash tax deferred asset""](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/twitter-twtr-q2-2020-earnings.html).   That messed up a slow but steady growing trendline.  How much so?  Check the CNBC graphic:

&#x200B;

[2Q: Whoops](https://preview.redd.it/5w9jwq0xsqv51.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c2b125cc477fbe98193a50746191b07b5d8a29)

Also during the last quarter, [Twitter had a massive hack](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/twitter-hackers-made-121000-in-bitcoin-analysis-shows.html) where some moron tried to use the accounts of famous people to try and sell (Edit; The currency that we doth not speak its name).  No word on which autist here did that.  The problems continued into the last few weeks, when [Twitter had a massive outage that the President blamed cited the Babylon Bee as Biden protection](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-babylon-bee-satricial-article-twitter-down-1539695).  That's more of a reminder that headline and political risk remains in all communication services stocks, and tomorrow we'll get a better reminder as the CEO's of Twitter, Facebook, and Microsoft testify before a Congress that hates them more than their own voters.

So Twitter has execution problems, political risk, and a CEO that is still trying to decide what he wants to be when he grows up.  Yet it's had a massive run up as pin action from SNAP.  Does it have further room to run?  Chart comparisons suggest it could.

&#x200B;

[Relative Performance of SNAP, PINS, TWTR, and FB](https://preview.redd.it/hlgkqayauqv51.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=e82dc96c22b80971df1d1adb237cb2544e9c4a28)

This is where I get heartburn on the short.  Over the past year, PINS and SNAP have had over a 150% return.  FB, much more established and with a market cap 20 times that of Twitter, has still given a respectable 46% return.  Twitter is up 73%, which is a lot...until you compare it to peers like SNAP and PINS.

Further, analysts are sour on Twitter, with 32 of 41 giving hold or underperform ratings, and a stock price 20% below current prices.  I tend to consider them a contra-indicator, in that they move after sentiment does, usually not before.

&#x200B;

So, I'm torn.  If Dorsey can demonstrate he has finally decided to execute a business plan and fix the recurring technical/security issues, there's real value to unlock here.   Short term....I'm probably willing to take a gamble that he hasn't, and buy a few puts.  What say y'all?

BABA,71k YOLO $BABA 290c 02/19/21,1605409719.0,"I was planning to wait a bit longer before entry, but I just couldn't resist as I witnessed some weird option price movements near the closing bell on Friday and honestly, $BABA is a steal at the current prices.

I'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% drop). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?

1. Alibaba holds a \~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the possible increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.
2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market.

However, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.

&#x200B;

[Tencent](https://preview.redd.it/bf1ru4s3fbz51.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0de9f7fee9e4a28168ceecd386a52aa7a81805)

While $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.

[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)

Guys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate.

Some more info about BABA for you value investors out there:

BABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC

AMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC

JD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC

BABA is incredibly underpriced.

Also, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.

The IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.

[More bullish sentiments from option traders](https://preview.redd.it/pqll1o1eibz51.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=918d67c20138035e4f2f82b1547fa86885242d46)

The fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.

Don't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.

I had some free time and went back to go look at the original footage of Jack Ma's speech two weeks ago, and for all that matters I'm Chinese.

Let's just say it wasn't great, he openly made the branches of government regulators: the Chinese SEC, and BRC look like fucking idiots, and tried to quote Xi while doing it. It became viral a few days ago when the news of the suspension hit. People in general are pretty pissed online, and I think that that mood is intentional since it matches the government's stance on the issue.

Jack Ma, founder of BABA and ""de facto head"" of ANT did things like:

""labeling the global banking Basel Accords as an “old people’s club,” Ma said “systemic risk” is not the issue in China. Rather, China’s biggest risk is that it “lacks a financial ecosystem.” Chinese banks are like “pawn shops”, where collateral and guarantees are the hard currencies. As a result, some decided to go so big they are not allowed to fail.""

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d_story.html)

I mean yes it's true these are actual issues, but calling them out for the entirety of the public and media to see is not how shit works in China. There have always been monopoly concerns for BABA both in their eCommerce branch as well as payment branch, which split into ANT.

A lot of people don't know wtf ANT does to earn a 300B+ valuation. Essentially besides being the main competitor to Wechat Pay (basically PYPL or SQ but more widespread, every single vendor in China and aims to serve Chinese customers will accept this), and also having the world's largest money management fund at one point from all the cash from their users that they put on the platform, they've loaned 2T+ RMB to individuals and small businesses (8/2 split). Which is about 300B. This is through two services called Jiebei and Huabei, essentially it's just like you doing cash withdrawal from your credit card but obviously, all of it is electronic at 18% interest per annum (which is high in China). Here's the thing, ANT started this whole thing with 3.8B RMB. They leveraged up 100x+ by selling tranched securities on their loans which they packaged. So ANT makes a shit ton of money, ""risk-free"" leveraged to the tits.

ANT ABS 1B RMB
https://imgur.com/a/PUJvl0Q

For every billion they loan out, 0.95B is recovered through selling the A and B Tranch at 6.1% and 7.5% interest respectively. Ant makes the difference between that and 18%. And can repeat that so on as they still have money. Which means 1/0.05 = 20x from banks and the market. This became closer to 100x+ after they used subsidiaries and other financial maneuvers to buy their own C tranch.


This is why the Chinese government is seriously pissed, there is a huge fucking default bomb that could lead to sector collapse since ANT sold off these securities to asset management and banks, and then used the money they gained from the securities to make more loans and make more securities. Thereby repeating the cycle precisely because the fintech company wasn't regulated at the same standard as Chinese banks. Now Jack Ma has the balls to come in and criticize the very thing that made his business possible in the first place?

A day after Jack Ma had the meeting with the big 4 regulatory agencies (Central Bank, SEC, Bank and Insurance Commission, and Foreign Exchange Commission), they released a draft of new legislation called  网络小额贷款业务管理暂行办法

There's no Official English but it means

**Laws Regarding The Current Management of Small Online Loans** (Draft)

Among the new laws, the chief one is that companies cannot leverage over 1x via bank loans, and leverage up to 4x through securitization, as well as the fact that the loan originator needs to provide over 30% of the amount.

So the reason BABA is dipping so hard is that this immediately fucks up the valuation of ANT, they need a serious injection of cash to stay afloat with their current loans. Which was precisely the point of the IPO. If ANT is valued as a bank rather than a fintech company (and that's what regulations suggest), then they're fucked. Now I don't think this means BABA is going to nosedive, but there are going to be better opportunities considering the headline risk.

**TLDR: My warning for anyone looking to buy the dip is that it's not as easy money as you think**

Positions:

AVOID BABA for at least the next month

Edit: Since price action has been nothing but positive for the market in general, very short calls will probably print. There may be more bad news in the horizon. It is my belief that JD is a better position that is similar in nature.

They’ve been working on a report for a while now, and it’s coming tomorrow. These guys have credibility. If it’s BABA, they are fucked, and your calls are fucked.

ARK sold off their BABA shares on 11/17, the report is coming 11/18. They would know of this was coming. Chinese stocks are at risk tomorrow, including EV.

I hope I’m wrong. I loaded baba calls today. The downside is so much larger than the upside. Be careful. Wait until the report comes to buy calls.

I’m retarded btw

EDIT: I’m not saying baba will guaranteed be fucked. I’m saying tomorrow is not the day to buy leaps. If you come back to this post angry because baba goes up tomorrow, you are as retarded as me.

* It's oversold and PE ratio is low (30) compared to some comparable companies (amazon is at 90)

BABA,"It’s time to buy the DIP on BABA, this is absolutely ridiculous- BABA DEC31 265C",1605720801.0,"Its time, I’m all in on the Babs as of today. 

70 points down from October highs and people are still selling Alibaba? What kind of autist would still be selling their shares at this point after riding out this entire plummet? This company sells 74 Billion dollars of merchandise in a week. Sure I could see a 10% drop in the stock from from the IPO delay, but we shouldn’t even be worried about the financial regulations, it’s going to be nothing more then good-faith and logical policies that are truly for the better. A high-risk major lender can single handily crash an economy, these policies are very necessary. 

Ant group is just another small cog in an otherwise massive machine that is Alibaba anyways, and this company is wayyyyyy oversold at this point. 
Alibaba makes so much fucking money, and has massive market share in a MASSIVE market. 

We all know the Ant group IPO being stopped was a major setback for the stock; but we have to remember that China does not have the financial regulations that the U.S. has, nor is China interested in stopping the development of a company that’s a major factor in their economic growth as a nation. So whatever Financial or E-Com policies they implement won’t be any worse then here in America. 

Don’t worry everyone, regulations or not being a big player in the payments and lending game results in nothing but cash. I can assure you no regulations are going to stop Chinese idiots from agreeing to the classic 25% APR auto and person loans, just like the regulations don’t stop idiots from doing it in America. 

Sure Jack Ma’s ugly ass is retarted for talking shit about his own government, but the man is the co-founder of Alibaba, and the current lending system is China is actually absolute trash so I don’t blame him for saying it. 

It’s only a matter of time before people realize that in no way would the Chinese government stop the growth of a company like Alibaba, they just want to make sure that don’t stomp every little guy in the process, and that Ant group doesn’t cause a literal economic collapse, which they absolutely could. 

Stop being fucking idiots and buy the dip, this mother fucker is going all the way back to 300 by year end guaranteed."

4) Find me any Chinese/EV/weed/solar/tech stock that isn’t up from last week.

5) What I’m tryna say is baba got fked last week by 2 bad news and hasn’t in no way priced in the election results (check prev earnings it always goes back up the next 1-3 days, as for ipo it’s delayed not cancelled and that pump happened 2 months ago...)
 
5.5) 11/11 but if you like to follow historical events and charts then sell the calls you buy the day of 

If baba didn’t have an earnings release or ant ipo was supposed to be at a later date and got the same results as JD last week (no news, just upcoming earnings) it would be currently sitting around 350, give baba half of that and you’re looking at a nice 10bagger ur welcome

BABA,Here's BABA 🍼 for all you babies 👶🏼,1605286902.0,"In technical terms, the observed correction of Alibaba's price is, in principle, natural.

The current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

In terms of comparable valuation, Alibaba is undervalued against the market.

DCF-based BABA stock price target suggests 100% upside potential.

#1 Price vs. Growth
Let's start with some purely technical parameters.

Starting from mid-2015, Alibaba's (BABA) stock price has been following, with varied success, its long-term exponential trend that acts as a smart average. Now, the company's current share price is synchronized with this trend, but until recently it has significantly outperformed it.

At the same time, looking at the rolling annual total price return, we can say that in the last few months, the rise in the price of Alibaba's stock has been excessive. And therefore, the observed correction is, in principle, natural.

Moving onto more fundamental parameters.

Over the past two quarters of the fiscal year 2021, the average expectations of analysts regarding the growth of BABA's revenue and EPS in the current and next fiscal year tend to increase. 

And here, it is pertinent to recall that more than 90% of the revenue Alibaba receives is in the domestic market.

In turn, China is the only large country in the world whose economy is growing during the coronavirus epidemic. Source: OECD

And there is virtually no coronavirus problem in China. 

In short, the company's external business environment looks optimistic.

Moving onto Alibaba's valuation. 

The long-term relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size is linear. Formally, this reflects investor confidence in the stability of the company's future growth rates.

By the way, this relationship identifies Alibaba's current capitalization as balanced. But, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q1 '22 FY, BABA's revenue TTM will be around $13 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational capitalization will come close to $900 billion.

The second one is the relationship between Alibaba's capitalization and the FCF TTM absolute size. In this case, the company's current price is balanced too:

In the context of the above, I believe that the current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

#2 Comparable Valuation
I single out two multiples, which makes it possible to compare Alibaba with the market. Both multiples are forward and both are adjusted for the growth rate of the basic indicators (I used a four-year CAGR).

Judging by the Forward P/S (next FY) multiple, Alibaba is undervalued now.

A comparative valuation of BABA through the Forward P/E (next FY) multiple also indicates that the company is undervalued.

In terms of comparable valuation, I believe Alibaba is undervalued against the market right now.

#3 DCF Valuation
To forecast the company's revenue for the next decade, I used a polynomial model that most closely matches the current average estimates of analysts. I believe that such approach is the least subjective.

To calculate the weighted average cost of capital, I used the current yield of China 10-Year Bond as a risk-free rate for the Chinese market (3.28%), equity risk premium (6.26%), and 3-year rolling beta coefficient (0.71). To calculate the cost of debt, I used the interest expense for 2019 and 2020 FY divided by the debt value for the same years.

When building the model, I used the following key assumptions:

In the next decade, Alibaba's operating margin will decline from the current 18% to 15% in a terminal year.

The relative size of CAPEX will be on average over the past six years.

The average tax rate will amount to 25%.

The DCF-based target price of Alibaba's shares is $541, offering 101% upside.

Bottom Line

In fact, China's economy is now the only one capable of showing growth. At the same time, the online shopping industry in China is booming due to fear of the pandemic. These are two powerful and undisputed growth drivers for Alibaba.

Chinese stock exchanges reacted mostly positively to the likely election of Biden as president of the United States. Although it is too early to draw conclusions, judging by the general tone in the media, it is expected that bilateral policy will become more predictable. At the very least, this reduces the risks for BABA.

Fundamentally, BABA is undervalued. It is obvious. And time will fix it.

TLDR: $BABA $295 4/21"

BABA,Ali baba stock falls sharply today,1604422870.0,"Hi friends, 
The Alibaba stock fell sharply today by nearly 10%, erasing most of these past few weeks’ gains. It seems to be connected to an affiliate company’s, Ant Group. failure to successfully launch its IPO, promised to be the largest in history. 

Do you believe this is a sign to reduce BABA, sell it, or an opportunity to get more baba stocks at discount. 

Alibaba is much larger than Amazon in terms of market share, yet the value of its stock is dramatically lower than Amazon’s, by a factor of ten. However, alibaba operates in the Chinese market, which everyone agrees is a much less mature and much less transparent market than the US financial market. Ant Group’s failure to put their stocks in the Hong Kong stock exchange due to a last moment disclosure issue is a dramatic illustration of the risk associated with investing in China. 

Where do you people stand on this issue?"
BABA,"$BABA - Jack Ma, Singles Day, Alibaba, Ants Financial",1605116208.0,"Who is telling the truth?

See news in Chinese for context -- it sounded really ugly.

&#x200B;

1. Yahoo etc say ""Alibaba Singles Day Sales (aka 11:11, Nov 11) Hit Record High $75 Billion""

Really? Check this out...

""Worst Nov 11 (China's equivalent of ""Prime Day/Black Friday"") in history: Jack Ma & buddies LOST $2 trillion in 2 days"" [https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml) ... Google for more (in Chinese of course). *NB: Yahoo and Wall Street have a stake in Alibaba?*

Google using Chinese characters 马云 =  Jack Ma = Mǎ Yún (马云)

Keypoint: Authority deliberately imposed many restrictions on labeling and  what can be sold on Alibaba's Taobao on Nov 11... To understand this strategy, read ""China tightens restrictions on Australian exports"" [https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537) ... same thing.

2. You must have heard of ""China drafts new antitrust guideline to rein in tech giants"" by now. What's the big deal? US and the west did the same thing, nothing happened.

Well, you must have forgotten conviction rate in China is literally 99.99%. That's the difference.

3. Ant Financials IPO - The politics behind the suspension isn't something Joe can understand.

First, the timing - why IPO suspended on the eve of the debut? This is directly due to the 5th China Communist Party plenum that ended just before Jack Ma & co were told their $3 trillion Ant Financials IPO was suspended.

Clue: No heir apparent as Xi Jinping reveals top leadership.

Still wondering what's happening? Here > The Boss wanna make sure all parties are obsessed with the world's largest IPO, happy, and create no trouble during the party plenum, which is the ""Bilderberg"" of China that may give birth to China's new leader (*against Xi Jinping who wanna rule forever*)

Second, non-bank money-lending is considered loan-sharking no matter how hard you try masqurade the sin as ""fintech"" -- no different from trying to bypass the Fed with any other form of money (just google what happened to those who tried...). This is not to say China is shutting down Ant Financials becos Jack Ma created a new cryptocurrency, it's becos Ant's microlending is seen as a timebomb for CCP.

How so? Google keywords like ""China P2P Lending Suicide Scandal"", you'd see why did China cracked down the so called hitech ""P2P Lending"" industry that left behind nothing good except social ills like suicides, bankruptcies, etc (many still listed as pennystocks on NASDAQ like KXIN, WEI, etc. -- all were given 2 years to wind down and do something else)... Ant Financials is no difference for CCP believes Jack Ma & co. will leave behind the same mess so big that it may collapse the CCP.

You see?

Plus, big-mouthed Jack Ma actually told this guy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang\_Qishan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qishan) that China regulators are dinosaur that neither understand nor capable of regulating ""fintech"".

tl;dr: Jack Ma is history -- He has been personally targeted to send out a clear message: ""Who's The Boss"" (just like why Trump fired Esper the other day). ""Xi Jinping going after Jack Ma's head"" [https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876](https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876)

BABA,$BABA - primed for a runup?,1605637252.0,"Open to discussion here - thinking about BABA as my next ""catalyst driven"" play. I was long AMC and TSLA (sold this morning) if you remember from post history. I think about stocks from a catalyst perspective (e.g. with AMC, all you need is one day of good news and it skyrocketed). 

For BABA - some of you may know the stock fell due to Ant Group pausing their IPO. Stock is down almost 20% since October 27th. Personally I think it's oversold and PE ratio is low (30) compared to some comparables (amazon at 90). I'm thinking about picking up some March/April calls for around $300. IV is also relatively low compared to others in the sector. As soon as the Ant IPO is back on we're back to where we were."

Some DD:

* Company has consistently shown strong growth and is very undervalued to this effect especially given the growth of their SSaS sector and domination in the transaction market with Alipay.

* Stock crashed hard because their ex-CEO guy pissed off the Chinese government who delayed the IPO of a company called ANT that they have 30% stake in. ANT IPO is set to be one of the biggest public openings ever.

* The Chinese government's dick was still rock hard so they decided to do my boy dirty and press regulations around monopolies on Alipay that many are skeptical are even gonna come to fruition after Winnie the Pooh has a nap.

* Company has amazing performance, strong growth, undervalued and a HUGE ASS IPO that got delayed but is still gonna happen in a few months with a big MOON coming its way.

* The stock crashed like $50 but those bear days are fucking over, its going back up and so my wallet and my dick."
BABA,$BABA is over sold. Very greedy to short this thinking it has any room left to fall at current price. The monopoly news is a joke and people/firms over reacted. BABA just did 74 billion in merchandise sales during its singles day event. 11/27 calls at 270,1605136851.0,

China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts

China Vows Escalation in Clampdown on Fintech's Dominance

China Issues 37 Directives in One Day to Cool a Wild Market 

Nothing but measures by China to cool down the market right now via regulatory threats. 

RIP 11/13 BABA callholders you guys are fuk, maybe a sliver of hope for 11/20 holders. If it continues to dump I'll probably load up on shares for long term. LEAPs may be the play here if it continues going down.

Alibaba singles day early earnings doesn't seem to soften the Hang Seng dump at all. Down -8.42% as we speak. The regulatory pressure is clearly overshadowing the Singles Day blowout.

Also take note the e-commerce earnings are offsetting their side gig cloud computing losses. It's better to closely monitor the news from China before your baba plays.

May not be something to really ""buy the dip"" on compared to your typical plays since there's a lack of confidence due to the massive clampdown by China. US BABA chart earlier kind of proved it.

Tread carefully comrades, seems like its going to be bearish this week. Or you could just go full retard and yolo on weekly calls.

BABA,Anyone else fked by BABA?,1605048897.0,"For real, first time I’ve seen a stock go through so many bad news reports and bad timing.
Week 0-4

1) stationed at 300-320

Week 5

1) ipo suspended

2) bad timing for suspension as it’s the same time all stocks TECH and Chinese stocks (jd/tencent, etc) all rose bigly 

3) ends the week with earnings miss so we get literally 0 pump before 11/11 starts

Week 6

1) day one - and of course techs get fucked cause vaccine hope, baba hasn’t even recovered anything yet (it hit 306 in hkg market that same day)

2) day two - China drafts new anti trust guidelines




What On earth is this, ive went from long term holding baba shares (400) to selling all to buy OTM calls during the first dip. Then having to average down due to IV crush after earnings THEN vaccine news THEN antitrust guidelines by China.

None of these are even events correlated to each other to soften the blow, each one coming from no where complete left field...


Luckily I was able to make some money on puts on ccl/m/jpm to offset the losses but if I had literally one day of late news release Id be able to cop a model s and downpayment on a rental property god damn it. There was 3 trading days between the crash where baba went back to 305 in hk market)


All I’m asking is +10 IV & 285 tmrw is that too much..?

China’s  stock market operator has pulled the rug from under the largest initial  public offering in global finance, calling a halt on the November 5  dual listing of Ant Group’s shares in the city’s technology board less  than 48 hours before the highly anticipated trading was due to start.

A  meeting earlier this week between Ant Group’s senior executives and  China’s top financial regulators constituted “significant change” in the  regulatory environment, which may lead to the fintech company not  fulfilling the listing requirements or disclosure rules of the exchange,  according to a statement by the Shanghai bourse operator.The Shanghai  Stock Exchange has decided to temporarily postpone the listing of Ant  Group, the market operator said.

Four Chinese regulatory bodies, led by the People’s Bank of China, [held a meeting yesterday with the top executives of Ant](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3108145/ant-group-executives-meet-chinese-regulators-days-trading-debut),  on the eve of the fintech company are due to make their trading debut  in Shanghai and Hong Kong in the world’s biggest initial public  offering.

The  regulators met with Ant Group’s co-founder Jack Ma, executive chairman  Eric Jing and chief executive Simon Hu, according to a statement by the  securities regulator, without elaborating on the purpose or content of  the meeting.

The  meeting also included representatives from the China Banking and  Insurance Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory  Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), the  currency regulator.

“On  November 2, 2020, Ma as controlling shareholder of Ant Group and Ant’s  management team met with Chinese financial regulators,” according to a  statement from the Hangzhou-based fintech company. “Views regarding the  health and stability of the financial sector were exchanged. Ant Group  is committed to implementing the meeting opinions in depth and  continuing our course based on the principles of: stable innovation;  embrace of regulation; service to the real economy; and win-win  cooperation. We will continue to improve our capabilities to provide  inclusive services and promote economic development to improve the lives  of ordinary citizens.”"

BABA,"SEC Pursues Plan Requiring Chinese Firms to Use Auditors Overseen by U.S: Under proposal, companies would be shut out of U.S. exchanges if they don’t comply",1605615668.0,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-pursues-plan-requiring-chinese-firms-to-use-auditors-overseen-by-u-s-11605614403

WASHINGTON—Chinese companies with shares traded in America would be required to use auditors overseen by U.S. regulators or face being kicked off exchanges under a plan being drafted by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposal, which is likely to be issued for public comment in December, would address the disparate treatment that applies to Chinese companies going public in the U.S. The firms have long been able to sell shares here, yet their auditors violate a key investor protection: China hasn’t allowed their work to be inspected.

Auditor supervision has been overseen by a special watchdog—the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board—since the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. nearly 20 years ago. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken different tacks to try to get China’s cooperation with the PCAOB, from suing its audit firms to get information on fraudulent companies, to negotiating with Chinese regulators and issuing public warnings to U.S. investors about the problem.

Now, the SEC’s proposal would put the onus on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq NDAQ -0.23% Stock Market to require compliance with the audit inspections—or bar a new Chinese company from listing. Those with shares already traded here would have a few years to comply before possibly losing their listing.

The SEC is moving fast to propose key elements of the plan before the departure of Chairman Jay Clayton, who announced Monday that he plans to leave by the end of December.

China has said it is worried about auditors revealing strategic secrets held by domestic firms, some of which are majority-owned by the Chinese government. The country put up a new hurdle this year, implementing a law that prevents its citizens and companies from complying with overseas securities regulators without the permission of its own market supervisor and other components of the Chinese government.


To address that issue, the SEC’s plan includes a separate proposal to allow Chinese firms to get a second review of their books by an accounting firm based in a country where auditors comply with PCAOB oversight. The audit firm doing the work would likely assume liability for the opinion it provides, and the PCAOB could check the work.

The details for such “co-audits” would need to be spelled out in a regulation. The SEC would have to address obstacles to such arrangements, including the political and regulatory risks the second auditor might encounter in China.

“How do you meet the U.S. goal which is an audit subject to a meaningful inspection, and what appears to be the Chinese goal of limiting the access to information held in China?” said Paul Leder, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier and former head of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs.

Another wild card: It’s unclear how much China still values access to U.S. exchanges for its companies, and thus how much it is willing to negotiate. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which went public on the NYSE in 2014, chose to raise $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. Ant Group Co., the fast-growing financial-technology giant that grew out of Alibaba, was set to raise $34 billion in Shanghai and Hong Kong before the Chinese government halted the deal.

The SEC’s proposals would take months to adopt and implement, and Mr. Clayton’s successor and the Biden administration could seek to tweak the approach.

The SEC’s anticipated moves follow recommendations issued by a panel of U.S. policy makers in July that suggested how to address the inspections standoff. The panel, known as the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, recommended tightening the exchanges’ standards for listing Chinese companies.


NYSE and Nasdaq have declined to voluntarily change their listing rules as the President’s Working Group suggested, people familiar with the matter said. Such a move could have taken effect more quickly than a new SEC regulation.

Nasdaq officials felt they couldn’t implement the listing rule without clearer guidance from the SEC about how co-audits would work, a person familiar with the matter said. Nasdaq in May moved to raise its minimum requirements for listing companies from countries where PCAOB cannot inspect auditors, a step that could discourage initial public offerings by smaller Chinese firms. NYSE declined to comment.

Booting Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets would hurt the revenues of NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE 0.36% and Nasdaq. The shares could still trade over the counter.

Both exchanges earn annual listing fees from such companies and benefit from the trading activity that comes from their shares. More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.


Congress is weighing its own solution. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements—or face delisting from Nasdaq and NYSE. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the House as an amendment to a defense-spending bill.

While the SEC plans to publicize its proposed actions in December, the agency will likely issue other proposals directing public companies and mutual funds to amplify their disclosure of the audit-inspection risks associated with China, the people said. Those other proposals may not be finished before Mr. Clayton leaves, the people said."

NVDA,A Grand correction play (Nvda DD),1604120655.0,"Okay degens,   


I'll get right on with the autism.   
Thurs/ Friday we saw a lot of the tech giants move toward correction territory.   
But one still has too much meat on the bone.   


Nvidia (NVDA) , though one of my favorite companies is likely to tank post (or before) earnings for the following reasons.  
1.) The acquisition of ARM is baked into the price. This is expected to be heavily contested by China, the UK , and the US (Who already is looking at tech under a microscope).   


2.) The ""Supercycle"" of new video cards is also baked in, but most retailers reporting inventory report receiving fewer than 20 units per week. The new cards on the onset had problems crashing, and the cards were software detuned in the following weeks. Also nvidia's board partners opted to use more expensive and reliable hardware to offset this problem, which may or may not erode part of the margin on these products. The in house fab cards already seem to have razor thin margins as the quality, materials, and manufacturing process by all accounts are expensive.  


3.) Nvidia leaks showed their hand too soon. Teases of the new gen video cards with double the memory capacity and possibly a better (7nm vs 8nm) die process has myself and many that I know waiting until their release to buy into this generation. ""Why buy a 700 product when I know one 40% faster is coming out behind it for probably $800.  


4.)  AMD  is catching up in this space, and will gain some market share this cycle. I can't forecast how much, but their new line of video cards while still a ways off of nvidia's prowess have gained some ground. AMD has successfully toppled intel's CPU dominance, and is targeting Nvidia's market now.  


5.) Game delays such as cyberpunk 2077 will delay buyers of the new gen into next quarter.  


6.) Most importantly, while most analysts are bullish about NVDA many value it in the $300-$350 range.  I know that this has been a less important factor in the past year. But the market shed a lot of weight this past week with big companies now trading at or under their avg analyst price target.   


I'm no professional, this isn't financial advise and all purely opinion. Also, Disclosure I have 2x $40 SQQQ calls exp 11/06, 20 SQQQ shares, and 20 SDOW shares. I may buy NVDA puts monday exp after earnings, and maybe more SQQQ Calls expiring later in Nov."
NVDA,NVDA: Impact of Amazon moving away from nVidia chips to custom ASICs?,1605299847.0,"In a [blog post for Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/majority-of-alexa-now-running-on-faster-more-cost-effective-amazon-ec2-inf1-instances/) yesterday, it seems Amazon has been developing their own ASICs (AWS Inferentia) to better power Alexa and their AI infrastructure, and the results seem pretty great - "" resulted in 25% lower end-to-end latency, and 30% lower cost compared to GPU-based instances for Alexa’s text-to-speech workloads.""

Since they're currently using NVIDIA GPUs to power this part of their business, what do you think the long term impact would be for NVIDIA? 

I suspect since Amazon's Alexa / AI side of the business will continue to grow, cutting NVIDIA out of the picture would be a significant blow to them, and a boon for Amazon. But maybe this could have also been one of the reasons NVIDIA sought to buy Arm a couple months ago?"

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up."
NVDA,"What is a True Market Leader (TML) + And how to find them? (Ex. SHOP 2016-2020, ZM 2020, AAPL 2005-2012",1604793787.0," 

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

Here is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)

NVDA,MRVL next great chip play,1606051877.0,"Ok so my first official DD but I’ve got some conviction around it so I thought I’d get the beautiful masses to opine

My thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:

1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets

2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That’s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players

3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. 

AND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. 

Here’s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:
Marvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message

4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. 


With earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it’s potential huge value that MRVL hasn’t run on. 

I’m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I’ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. 

100 12/11 46c
50 1/21/22 50c 

TLDR: buy MRVL. You’ll thank me later


Side note: I’m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I’d love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see."

NVDA,NVIDIA DD,1605463056.0,"I'm not seeing a lot about NVIDIA so here's my DD.  It reports earnings on 11/18 after market close.  Expectations are high.  Revenues are expected to be around 4.4 billion, a 46% increase year over year.  EPS are expected to be $2.57, an increase of 44% year over year.  NVDA has beat the last 4 earnings by an average of 11.5%.  

They are expected to have benefited from sales growth in graphic chips due to the pandemic and more people working from home, but there are concerns that supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact.  Last month,[they announced](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/october-2020-rtx-blockbuster-and-indie-game-update/) that Minecraft, Black OPS Cold War, and many other huge games would be using their RTX ray tracing technology. 

[They have also partnered](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-cloud-computing/) with every major cloud-based solution platform to optimize performance of these services through their GPU hardware. 

There have been 35 upward revisions from analysts in the last 3 months leading to this earnings report, and 0 downward revisions. 

As far as technicals go, it is undoubtedly trading at a much higher multiple that it probably should be, but we all know the entire market is extremely inflated.  It recently underwent a 14% sell off from its high of $589, and is currently sitting at $531.88.  It bounced nearly perfectly off its 50 day EMA on Friday, the Stoch RSI on the daily crossed bullish, and the MACD on the hourly is close to crossing bullish.  

My position, entered Friday, is 12/4 545c.  The IV is only 54%.  I think NVDA is set up for a run into Thursday, and could see it working back up to its all time high.   I think this could be another example of a very good earnings report that leads to a sell off after reporting because of the expectations are just insanely high.  I'm going to hopefully ride the wave into Thursday, then make the call on whether to hold through the report or not.  BOL"
NVDA,First Quarter Results: 3 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and overall you're up 10-11%,1605282523.0,"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, I've aggregated the results after one quarter has passed.  See below for takeaways after \~3 months.

Note: you can view a visual version here: [https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png](https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png)

Key takeaways:

* Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%
* Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by /u/Carrera_GT, /u/makesalotofmoney, /u/Charlie_Brown364
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%
* If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%

NVDA,Want to make money? Buy Dell,1606087017.0,"Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)

Now the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. 

Now I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!

But, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/

They have a 3 sections.

VMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.

I believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)

Also NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.

Now onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.

Now Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%

Also there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded

NVDA,"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",1605246827.0,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Estée Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company’s CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company’s gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it’s never your fault. It’s the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic."

NVDA,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020",1605373593.0,"Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
> That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
> In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
> The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
> # Next hurdle for market
> “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
> The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
> Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
> The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
> # Value vs growth
> Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
> Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&P 500.
*****
> In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
> “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
> Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

> # A Very Good Ten

> With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

> So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

> In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

> # November Expiration Week: S&P 500 & DJIA Stronger

> DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

> S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

> # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

> DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

> This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # New High in New 52 Week Highs

> As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

> Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

> # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

> No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

> In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

> # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

> Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

> # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

> With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

> In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

> Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

> # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

> For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

> The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

> # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

> Pfizer’s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the “go-to” positions throughout most of the pandemic.

> The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

> Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets."
NVDA,The Curious Case for Clean Energy,1605975954.0,"So we've all seen what weaponized autism can do to stocks like NIO and Tesla and I'm here to say things are just getting started. The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). 

So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. 

So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.

Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

TLDR: buy clean energy etf calls
Positions: ICLN 22-25c 4/21 and Ford 7-9-12 1/21 & 1/22"
NVDA,AMD is an absolute STEAL at $75,1604149460.0,"I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up in a few days. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.

&#x200B;

So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:

&#x200B;

[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)

First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.

&#x200B;

[**35B Xilinx Takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMfNlCZPsBQ)

Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:

[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)

[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)

Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits.

&#x200B;

[**New GPU Reveal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpgu-cTjyM)

Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**

This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: [He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ackqH7a40)

&#x200B;

**RISK**

Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.

&#x200B;

Positions:

AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants."

NVDA,[SYNA] Earnings Play - Synaptics (They report Nov 5th),1603981625.0,"Listen up, autists. If you are looking for the next great semiconductor/IoT play, look no further. Get yourselves familiar with a messiah named Michael Hurlston and his ark named Synaptics. Let him take you to the promised land.

1) What is Synaptics?

For almost 35 years, Synaptics has been focused on how people interact with devices. The company has created technology for touchscreens, touchpads, and fingerprint readers, and in recent years has focused on displays and touchscreens used in mobile phones. Synaptics makes parts used in Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Google Home speakers, and automotive touchscreens, among other applications.

Synaptics’ fortunes flagged in recent years, hurt by a drifting corporate mission and growing competition from Asia. Revenue in the June 2020 fiscal year was $1.33 billion, about 10% below the year-earlier level, marking the third straight year of declining revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $5.95 a share, up from $4 in fiscal 2019, reversing four consecutive years of declining profits.


2) Who is Michael Hurlston?

This savior became SYNA’s CEO about a year ago. When Michael Hurlston became CEO of Synaptics a year ago, the chip seller was a “bag of parts,” he says. “Job No. 1 was to make the most out of each part of the portfolio.”

Hurlston, 53, has done that, and more, chopping costs, shedding weak operations, making smart acquisitions, and burnishing the financial outlook of the San Jose, Calif.–based company, which makes components used in human-machine interface applications. So far, investors like what they see: Synaptics’ stock has rallied almost 150% in the past 12 months, reversing the prior four years’ losses. More gains could lie ahead, as Hurlston and his team continue to restructure and grow the business.

Hurlston seems a good choice to move things forward. Most recently he was CEO of Finisar, an optical-networking component company that he sold to II-VI for $3.2 billion within a year of his arrival. Before that, he was senior vice president for mobile, wireless, and connectivity products at Broadcom. More on that in a moment.

“When I arrived here, the company was undermanaged,” Hurlston said in a Zoom interview from his office. “There just wasn’t a lot of rigor around anything we did—no regular engineering reviews, or budget reviews, or general tracking of progress.”

Hurlston restructured the product portfolio, selling a business that makes integrated touch and display chips for LCD phones to a Chinese private-equity firm. Most high-end phones now use OLED displays, with LCDs used primarily in lower-end devices, he noted. Competition was fierce, and margins were ebbing.

Two acquisitions then followed, both closing in July. Synaptics bought DisplayLink, a Palo Alto–based company with a lock on the market for components used in universal docking stations, for $305 million in cash. “They’re the only company that has been able to figure this out,” Hurlston said.

The transaction was immediately accretive to earnings.

Synaptics also spent $250 million for Broadcom’s wireless Internet of Things business, which includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS technologies. Hurlston knew that business intimately: He used to run it. “We felt like there were a lot of places where we needed wireless assets,” he said, citing video and audio products and wireless docking stations. “It’s a deal that only we could have done. My old team was involved, and some of them came over here.”

He sees applications in wearables, surveillance cameras, and video set-top boxes.


3) Valuation?

At a recent $78~/share, Synaptics trades for just over two times estimated revenue and less than 13 times expected profit for the June-2021 fiscal year. Competitors, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and Microchip Technology (MC HP ), fetch five to 10 times current-year revenue, suggesting Synaptics is underappreciated in every sense of the word.

Furthermore, when SYNA beat their numbers in the last earnings call (and raised Q1 guidance), the stock jumped significantly and briefly touched 52 week high ($90~/share) before the stock retreated along with the market over the last 3 months. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about this company’s future prospects. They purchased IoT portfolio from Broadcom (AVGO) and they are focusing on high margin segments and once again, this stock is ripe for another beat when they report on Nov 5th. It is not out of the question that the stock will continue to march over the next 12 months and if you missed out on AMD/NVDA and other semiconductor play, this is the stock that you have been looking for.

Lastly, per Michael Hurlston who has a track record of turning around companies like Finisar, Synaptics had become a “$1 billion revenue company in the body of a $2 billion revenue company,” with an inefficient structure. For example, its PC business had a core design center in Taiwan’s capital city of Taipei, and offices in Armenia; Hyderabad, India; and the U.S. He closed all but the Taipei office, located near PC design operations for customers HP Inc. and Dell. “I did that kind of thing across the business,” he said. The result: Quarterly operating expenses fell to about $80 million from $110 million, and head count dropped to 1,200 from 1,700.

Meanwhile, Synaptics’ gross profit margins have risen in the past year to nearly 50% from under 40%. The company is configured, he says, to grow revenue in the 4% to 6% range, with profits rising faster as margins expand. Analysts expect Synaptics to earn $6.49 a share this year on revenue of $1.3 billion. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh thinks that earnings could top $8 a share in fiscal 2022. The stock “looks inexpensive with multiple ways to outperform,” he recently wrote.

4) Street Coverage

Paul Wick, a portfolio manager with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, owns more than 10% of Synaptics’ shares in the Columbia Seligman Communications & Information fund (SLMCX), which he has run for more than 30 years. He’s a big Hurlston fan, and has been impressed with the new focus on growth and operating efficiency. Wick recalls how Hurlston was astonished by the huge number of fabs and test and assembly houses Synaptics was using. “They weren’t getting volume discounts from anyone,” Wick says. “They were able to reduce the number of vendors and get better pricing.”

Compare JNJ to a compatriot when it was founded ACU. Acme United is focused mostly on office, first aid, and cutting equipment with a market cap under 100M. It’s very easy to grow 10% only needing 10M. On the other hand JNJ would need to earn tens of billions to achieve similar growth. By breaking up into smaller companies they could more easily focus on growing as smaller companies and focusing on individual businesses which would release shareholder value.

DIS,Balls Deep in $MGNI,1606228192.0,"Alright tardos come listen as I tell you how you too can make money.

$MGNI

Earnings Call:

Take a look at the recent earnings revenue year over year is up 62.01% beating by 7.4 million. EPS is up 2.5 times the estimate being expectations by 0.10 per share. Imagine how good you would feel if you ever hit 62.01% gain in your portfolio let alone in a year.

What do they do?

They sell ads. Specifically to streaming companies like Hulu, so while you're sitting there watching Rick and Morty wondering why you can't afford ad free Hulu $MGNI are the ones to thank for the ads you're watching.

Fundamentals:

Streaming platforms and access is expanding at a very fast rate. More houses are buying more streaming devices (phones, tablets, smart TVs). Their viewership grew 50% last quarter. Ad space is in high demand right now with the holidays as well as political ads that have and will run. Since Joe Biden won and coronavirus is over ad space is back in high demand with companies fiending for a spot on hulu and peacock. There's also like 15 different apes (money managers) ""raising price targets"" whatever that means. 

Stock is up 80% over the month and 54% over the week. The stock will hit $30 before. Options are cheap and going to rise. 

Edit:
u/mcf19 added how they're eliminating third party cookies, DIS and how their balance sheet is elite. Good info I wanted to add.
""I went in two weeks ago on MGNI 15c 12/18 ($0.10 then, now $2.50 plus). Their costs almost entirely fixed at this point and they have virtually no debt. 84% of their debt is ""A/P - seller"" which is money captured in transit between advertisers and the platforms they service. The other 10% of their debt is lease obligations and they have two small offices (gives a picture of how little debt they have). Super healthy company. With cookies going away on browsers and the new unified ID 2.0 initiative being implemented, this could blow up. Disney year end call on 12/10 will be huge for this, should give better (positive) details about the relationship between MGNI/DIS with the streaming platforms.

DIS,First Quarter Results: 3 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and overall you're up 10-11%,1605282523.0,"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, I've aggregated the results after one quarter has passed.

DIS,UPDATE: VIRGIN GALACTIC (SPCE) – THE $1000 CASE FOR SPCE,1605465461.0,"**UPDATE: VIRGIN GALACTIC (SPCE) – THE $1000 CASE FOR SPCE**

We are updating our forecasts to incorporate wildly improbable, yet possible, scenarios for Virgin Galactic. Our updated forecasts are guided by management comments and a recent jenkem-fueled all-nighter, which we believe have not been fully appreciated by the broader market. Forecasts below and fuck you in advance.

**Bottomline: SPCE stock or LEAPS**

**Main Updates**

We are raising our forecasts for space tourism revenue, primarily driven by a significant increase in our pricing assumptions over the near term. 

We are guided by management comments that suggest there will be robust demand for a supply constrained experience:

“I am very bullish on the transformational experience that we intend to deliver and **the price points we believe we could command** for this one of a kind supply constrained product.” – Michael Colglazier (CEO), November 5, 2020

“Yes, I think our pricing strategy is going to evolve off the experience, but one of the things that I am excited about is when you have a truly incredible product and one that will be supply constrained as opposed to demand constrained, **it gives a lot of flexibility into our pricing model**.” - Jonathan Campagna (CFO), November 5, 2020

Virgin Galactic will be re-opening ticket sales in 1Q21 and we expect individuals with net worths in excess of $500Mn to bid up prices as they compete to be part of the first 3,000 ticket holders. As such, we believe that ticket prices could rise as high as $3Mn in the near term. Keep in mind, one of these sick bastards once offered to pay Britney Spears $10Mn to sleep with him….the money for outrageous shit is there.

Globally, there are approximately 10,000 people worth $500Mn+. When incorporating an estimated average family size of 5, we believe there are 50,000 people that could afford a $1Mn+ ticket price. Given the supply constraints associated with this experience, we estimate that at least 3,000 of these individuals will bid up the price to become among the first commercial astronauts. As such, we see high margin revenue showing hockey stick growth over the next three years. 

**Space Mining**

We have incorporated space mining into our VG forecasts. There is a $10,000 quadrillion asteroid out there and we believe Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and Blue Origin will be actively developing technologies over the coming years to exploit these types of situations. We see the possibility of space companies disrupting the mining industry by 2030.

**Catalysts**

We expect significant appreciation over the next 12 months. The following catalysts have the possibility to materially impact the Company’s valuation.

**November, 2020** – SpaceX launch in the next few days

**November 19-23, 2020** \- First spaceflight from Spaceport America – (Potential 2 week delay due to NM government)

**January/February 2021** – Second spaceflight from Spaceport America

**February 2021** – 4Q Earnings – update on ticket pricing and hypersonic travel

**March 2021** – Branson goes to space….VG becomes a household name (wife’s boyfriend starts talking about it)

**April-July 2021** – Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space.

**Technicals**

I’ve also included some lines that I drew that may or may not be important. Close over $24 on high volume breaks the 12 month wedge = stock price might go higher. Ton of options outstanding + significant short interest = possibility of massive short/gamma squeeze.

DIS,Disney Puts??,1605548730.0,"I know betting agains't the mouse is ill advised but come on, this is ridiculous, Disney is trading at almost ATH, its worth more right now than before the pandemic and most of its parks aren't even open....

Am I missing something?? Seems like it wouldn't take much for this stock to get spooked in the next few weeks given we're at the beginning of a serious 2nd wave.

I also picked up some zoom shares hoping this is a dip. After Thanksgiving I'm betting zoom rallies and covid sensitive stocks like theatres, airlines and entertainment tank again.

Positions:  
DIS 12/18 $125P  
DIS 1/15 $125P  
AMC 11/27 $3.5P (been holding this one for a while, but shoulda sold when it was up 90% lol)

I already bought them but no problem being called a retard, just tell me why lol"
DIS,The saddest gay bear story of the week,1605723530.0,"So late last week I brought my tendies down from the freezer to the fridge with the intention of grilling them nicely in my oven after some gains...

They stayed there because I was too busy trying to trade for more tendies...

Earlier this week I had to throw them out since they'd been sitting in the fridge too long. I should have known it was a sign...

Most of my open positions were puts and I should have known better. I made the rookie mistake of assuming the market would react logically to information. Maybe I was drunk or something, I don't even know.

I did all the naughty things, I went against the market, I fucked with the mouse, and I had forsaken our lord Elon and his chinese cousins.

Needless to say, all my monies are gone now, as all my positions are worth pennies

DIS,"Future of ""Tourism Recovery"" stocks?",1604683902.0,"So now it is obvious Biden won, what do you guys think of the ""tourism recovery"" type of stocks. I was expecting Trump to win which would pave for a recovery in the tourism stocks sometime in mid 2021 or late 2021. I have a feeling that Biden is going to get very aggressive at controlling COVID as it was one of his campaign promises. Having people going on vacations or going out is probably the biggest way COVID gets spread and it is mostly non-essential part of the economy. 

Ironically enough, I have positive gains on all of my tourism stocks so I'm thinking of getting out while I am ahead. Thoughts?

I have DIS, BA, MAR and CCL.

Thank you"
DIS,Cramerica - the retail investor is buying even ATH - load up them calls,1605624013.0,"So, in short, on Mad Money last night, cramerica was in rare form, calling the market irrational, and highlighted the chart on DIS.  In looking at the price, effectively he stated that you never knew the world was in the middle of a pandemic.  If you have roku, just load up cnbc, and watch the segments, his dissertation of sorts leads one to believe that irrational behavior can ONLY be described if an irrational person acts rationally.  In short, retail has come to the rescue, NOT THE FED, and retail is buying high, and buying higher.  Call it FOMO, but there is rationale here.  Really you can make a market like this work if and ONLY if we are willing to buy at any level.  

Takeaway, calls!  You can get on your high-horse with technicals, and that's all fine and good.  Stop looking at valuation, don't think too hard, just think what this forum can do.  Who needs the value shift, just need to be willing to buy.  

This post is way too TLDR.....  let's go with opportunities here

FSR 30c feb 2021

SPY 400c jan 2021 (unless you can find your winner winner chix dinner)

TSLA, pick your number, hopefully you've been playing 10% OTM calls, yea you lost on some print, but today is a REWARD day, so don't bitch about its valuation, for short, no duh !

NIO 10p 2022 (bc we all lose if China is winning) - Trump may have been onto something

Send a message to the MMs screaming to put money into emerging markets, code for shit storm communist/socialist nations which control consumers, listen to these posts.  

Want to truly make America great, invest in US !  Let the rest of the world become what we degens already are... stack the table, let's add more aces and 10s to the deck for our version of blackjack.  Let's take it to the MMs, they will continue to play rotation, trying to suck us dry, let's force their hand to have to buy stocks are outrageous prices to sell us those ATM calls.

After watching that cramerica segment (i'm kinda perma-bear) i have now converted.  i think his DD must come from wsb.... and the quant crackers have to be screening our stuff.  and i say LET THEM !  buy the news and buy the rumor, calls print and we all eat."
DIS,This sub really has bunch of liptards and degenerates,1605824362.0,"Can’t even spell definitely right
Defently my ass 
Have fun losing money cock sucking each other thinking you are some DiCaprio Jordan Wall Streeter when you are degenerated autist virgin dumbfuck headass with 1inch penis cock head ass bitch"
DIS,"I trained a GPT-2 model with the top posts from this sub, and this was the first result I got. It's beautiful",1604676603.0,"I don't invest but if I buy into it I make $HPLC run around $50k in a row.

YTD graph, it's been an insane wild ride. During the day I am usually in the lead. Almost all my profits are made by the market. At night I am the market capitalist, buying stuff at market when prices are still very high.

At night I just dump everything I own into bearish positions and buy fucking anything but market. AnyTHING. I do not have ANY RESPECT FOR LUV MONEY.

EDIT: I can fucking make do. Just sit tight and do what feels right.

EDIT2:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently sits around at the top of a US stock market ranking for 5 months or so, I make sure to offset any post-bid gains by up to 25% of my post-bid profits. This seems reasonable to me. Then I have a very destructive thought process. I look at the trend since I think the stock was trending or not since it was MARCH 1 and I think long term. Is it still around though? - This is why crazy markets tend to stay cagier. You want to kill the red flag but still have a green light? YOLOs.

EDIT3:

I usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.

10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my gain so far have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.

EDIT4:

If you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one ""strategy"" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\~ or so from this.

But then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.

Learning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to ""outsmart"" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.

EDIT6:

Almost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)

EDIT7:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at the top of a current calendar year, I mean period, process is labor of sweat. More specifically, how many months do you have left in your current calendar year? That would be the biggest component I look at. (<3 months)

EDIT8:

Many people seem to miss key points in this post. Some will say this is part of the job. My job is to help people why other workers should too. My job is to help people anyway. Doesn't fucking matter which way you slice it.

CRM,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. This week's positions: DOCU, CRM, JD, & PYPL earnings YOLO",1604270917.0,"Sup stonkF@GS its ya boy aMereMortal and I heard you all like eating crayons so I decided to actually use them to draw pretty (r3tard3d) lines on stock charts before you shove them in your nose and mouth. Yes stocks are random, but from time to fucking time they bounce off zones of supply and demand also known as support and resistance you fucks. I've stopped going full autismo lately and have been mixing up my calls with some theta shit and guess what now my trading account is almost back to break-even after being down 20 G's in April.

Here are the moves for the week. Purple lines indicate a channel the stock trades in, blue lines are the same color as your balls and represent hard lines of support, aka where the dip buyers come in to steal your shares after you've panic sold them like a little bitch. Typically when a stock goes outside the purple lines it reverts back to the mean at some point. The further it goes outside the channel, the faster it \*might\* get back inside the channel. This is well represented in the first chart below.

**DOCU**  


DOCU is one of the top covid plays and with shutdowns and bullshit coming full force, I like this stock right here. Not only that, but if any of you morons ever move out of your mom's basement and sign important documents, you will notice many agencies actually use this service. DOCU has dropped 20 fucking percent in one week and is trading at the bottom of the channel which leads me to believe this is a buy at these levels.

**JD**

Next up we have JD.com which is like the SHOPIFY for China, except its better than shopify. If you've been following China and their GDP numbers you will see that they are on track to have the fastest recovery from covid. I don't give a fuck if the numbers are fake and the recovery is fake, they will need to pump fake earnings across the board to make it seem like everything is going well anyways. This stock right here is trading directly in the center of my imaginary purple lines which mean stonks might go up or down, but with earnings right around the corner you can bet your pet hamster this thing will be trading in the $90's soon.

**CRM**

CRM, also known as Salesforce, is a monster of a stock. The company is having explosive growth, and it's not because of covid but because they have a high quality lead-generation product that almost every profitable business wants to use. We are trading at the very bottom of this channel and are almost back to the price of last earnings report. I like this setup because I see maybe a 10% downside, but I also see infinity upside. That's what I call a win-win situation.

**PYPL earnings YOLO**

Lastly, lets look at Paypal. This company has been scamming users for fee's since before you were even born... but guess what. If we look at Shopify's earnings report we will see that e-commerce is absolutely fucking booming. Right now there are only 2-3 payment methods that have a monopoly on online purchases. It's either your wife's boyfriend's credit card, stripe, or fucking paypal. Shopify sales booming, amazon sales booming, all around e-commerce is booming, and paypal will reap benefits until the growth begins to slow... we can thank this virus for breathing life into this shit-stronk. This ticker is also trading right at the bottom of the range due to this massive decline we just saw last week. Lots of buying opportunities came about, but too bad you all only had 15 cents left in your account.

CRM,"How do you approach ""intangible"" investing?",1605374770.0,"The Economist this weekend has some great articles on this ([1](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/11/12/value-investing-is-struggling-to-remain-relevant), [2](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/14/does-value-investing-still-work)). I don't really want to push the view that value investing doesn't work anymore; I think that's a red herring. I would love to dig into the idea of ""intangible"" assets being more valuable, yet also that most investors don't understand them.

I believe my entire investment strategy over the past 8 years has been focused on intangible assets that end up generating large amounts of revenue for companies, but only after years of investment. These include data assets, advertising models fuelled by eyeballs, or enablement of marketplaces (e.g., Shopify, Airbnb, SEA Group, etc.). 

The way I tend to approach intangible investments is to answer ""yes"" to all of the following questions:

1. Does the company have an effective product that *some* people (i.e., a small current market) consider ""best in the market""?
2. If the product moves from *some* people buying it to *most* people buying it, will the company 10x its market cap?
3. Are there current players in the space that are 10x bigger than the company? This shows me that it's possible to displace/disrupt current leaders with a new product and strategy and actually capture a massive market. Think: Netflix in its early days (vs. Blockbuster), think Shopify on its IPO day vs. PayPal, Ebay, etc...
4. Do I believe the management team and founders could execute on this?

There are other signals to look for; if I'm right 1/3 of the time and make 10x on those companies, while losing on everyone else, the portfolio can still 3x itself... Sort of like a VC strategy in public markets. I can write *pages* on this topic, but would rather hear how other people approach intangible investment strategies.

Does anyone here have an intangible investment strategy? If so, how do you think about this?"
CRM,LONG $HON QUANTUM SUPREMACY,1605489960.0,"**Honeywell and the Quantum Computing Revolution**

Honeywell is a huge industrial conglomerate that has been a legacy manufacturing company for several decades now. Many of you know what the company is, but you probably also know them vaguely compared to some of their other industrial competitors such as General Electric. Honeywell is a huge defense contractor and a manufacturer of productivity and building solutions such as thermostats, security systems, and air purifiers. Honeywell’s aerospace division manufactures engines and provides integrated avionics solutions along with them. Honeywell also manufactures automobile parts such as turbochargers and electricity solutions. On top of that, they provide the software necessary for a lot of their own tools and technologies to function. You could say that Honeywell is a large legacy company that has a solid line of products, it functions in an industry where there’s not much new competition grabbing at your throat, and that in and of itself makes it a buy. However, while Honeywell may have fit into the average portfolio that needs manufacturing just fine, it’s not exactly an amazing value. It has several large competitors domestically and internationally and they don’t do seemingly anything outside of the ordinary that GE (which is a better value) does, or that Siemens (an international competitor) does. As far as the average investor can tell, there’s no growth prospect for him and as far as the experienced one can tell, there’s no opportunity within the company either. However, as I was going through the news (as an investor should) I discovered that [Honeywell is developing their own quantum computer](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/06/the-worlds-highest-performing-quantum-computer-is-here), which should position it very nicely for an investor looking for safe and sustainable growth as Honeywell has some very solid financials and the potential in the quantum computing segment is huge. Due to COVID-19, their past quarterly results were significantly down as their aerospace revenues depend significantly on global air traffic, but their share prices haven’t suffered much and that I believe has primarily to do with the 2 things I’ll discuss in here; an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a high-growth potential industry. 

Let’s start off looking at Honeywell’s finances:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zuypj8ra7iz51.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10faea11f73330047e1f50ac8b7ffc127d6263a

For the past few years, cash has grown at a far higher rate when in proportion to total debt

Here’s a peak into Honeywell’s Income statement, whose growth has been pretty constant until (seemingly) last year. But the reason revenue and Net Income shrank was due to two spin-offs that provided over $10B for them. When factoring for revenue lost due to the sold assets/liabilities, Honeywell’s revenue actually grew by 4% from 2018-2019

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/26e8ppsm7iz51.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d943e978251e21325c6159b15a73b4dfab42a0

  
Due to the sales of unprofitable assets, Honeywell’s gross profit margins have increased significantly in the past 2 years

https://preview.redd.it/eektjqhn7iz51.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=d51b0eeaac3cead22bae66dca982a51398ad2ba5

This explains the EBITDA growth over the past few years as well

&#x200B;

Here’s how Honeywell’s divisions split up currently, with aerospace making up most of their sales, and that division has increased sales by 9% from 2018-2019 when adjusting for spin-offs .

And here’s their SGA Expenses per $ of gross profit

Their profit consistency compared to General Electric or Boeing, two similar industrials companies is remarkable:

Honeywell clearly knows how to manage their financials despite being a complicated conglomerate, which is why their stock price has recovered so well compared to BA and GE. This shows that regardless of how overvalued it may be, that’ll be justified by the means of their consistently growing profits. Investors seek conservative companies such as Honeywell, especially during times of financial volatility, which is why the stock price has fared so much better during these past couple of months compared to their competitors.

**The Future:**

This year despite all of the troubles with COVID-19, Honeywell was able to deliver on their promise of making the world’s highest-performing quantum computer this year. You’ve probably heard the term, but haven’t really bothered to try and understand it. Here, I’ll draw out a very basic dichotomy between a normal computer and a quantum computer.

Traditional computers perform their problem solving through processing information in “bits” which are binary (0s and 1s). These bits are processed through transistors as electrons, but as transistors get smaller and smaller, they reach a point at which the laws of quantum mechanics prevent any further shrinkage. Quantum computers would process information as qubits, and these blocks of information can contain any proportion of 0s and 1s inside of them (superposition), and this greatly increases their information storage capabilities we’d have for problem solving. Another important property of qubits is their ability to become entangled; to have two particles change in accordance with each other, unlocking powerful parallel processing opportunities.

Quantum computing will be an essential technology for Artificial Intelligence, because AI is very simulation and probability based, the nature of quantum computers processing power would be ideal in order to accelerate the parallel processing needed to train and use ML models. In order to solve for the amount of simulations you need for AI-based solutions, the qubit would be the perfect means to solve them. AI solutions can range from cryptography, financial modeling, weather forecasting, and even particle physics.

“[For example](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2019/11/the-future-of-quantum-computing), pharmaceutical companies could accelerate the discovery of new drugs, materials companies could discover new molecular structures, finance companies could develop new trading strategies, transportation companies could optimize logistics, and companies relying on the output of machine and deep learning could perform analyses that are impossible with classical computing of today”

Honeywell is partnering with Microsoft Azure Quantum to enable their computer and they already have a client using it in JP Morgan. Honeywell Ventures has also invested in two large quantum computing companies, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum. Add to that Honeywell’s quantum supremacy: “With a quantum volume of 64, the Honeywell quantum computer is twice as powerful as the next alternative in the industry”

Due to the particularly industrial nature of quantum computers themselves, Honeywell is actually not a surprising entrant into this space. They already have an extensive software segment, and aren’t a slouch there by any means either. Honeywell’s system has [double](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) the quantum volume of IBM’s quantum computer. Honeywell also “[unveiled](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) a two-tier subscription plan designed to make it easier and less expensive for users to upgrade quantum systems”. If Honeywell can successfully create a subscription model for easier quantum accessibility, it would be the next biggest enterprise solution software, magnitudes greater than something simple like CRM. It’s obviously a very complicated and foggy outlook still as to the mysteries of quantum computing, but we know the potential would be tremendous and it could create another leap in the types of problems we can solve as a civilization. 

Not only is a Honeywell a decent value stock by itself, it also has tons of potential with this new segment which investors are clearly pricing in. There are pretty much no events or anything that can cause some awesome volatility for us to bank off, but I think in the next 2-5 year span we'll see a good amount of growth if this works out, so hold stock, but be on the lookout for any announcements that you could possibly play (again no short term play here, sorry)

Sunday eve I [posted my plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) for the week and opened those positions Monday morning. Sitting on about $4k profits which I've closed out some and may or may not let the others ride out for a few additional percentage points. Think I might take out your wife for some nice lobster and then to pound-town to finish off a good week. My next play is absolutely free money and literally wont go tits up.

**Weekend Plays**

CRM - Salesforce: 100 shares @ $237 cost basis. Currently $251 per share and 6% profit or $1,400.

DOCU: Sold 2x cash secured puts for $1,700 and closed them out this morning at $272 for $1,400 gain.

JD: Sold 2x CSP for $640. Up $400 and will let the rest ride.

PYPL: Sold 3x CSP for earnings and closed yesterday at $600 profit when the stock was flat in the morning.

These plays had minimal risk since the stocks would need to drop another 5-10% for me to be assigned. I knew mango man had my back and wouldn't let me down. Positions -Yes I'm using all the margin and buying power my account has to offer, but if I could use more I would since this put-selling is pretty fucking hard to fail at.

ADBE,IPOB (Opendoor) - Nameplate Institutions Piling In Ahead of Merger Expected in December,1605987969.0,"Some interesting developments on the institutional holdings front:

\- Ark Funds - up to 3MM shares. They continue to add at a 10K/share a day clip on average. Their biggest bet has been TSLA and known as one of the best performing technology funds out there

\- Suvretta Capital Management: 4.1MM shares. Run by a former SAC (Steve Cohen) investment professional who also worked at Soros Capital Management. Other big investments include ADBE, AMZN 

\- Soros Capital Management: now in for 1MM shares. A new position. Everyone knows who this guy is. 

\- FMR LLC - newly added about 800K shares. They are a little known money manager called Fidelity. As one of the biggest mutual fund/money managers in existence, this is huge. 

These four groups provide tremendous validation to IPOB/Opendoor - nameplate anchors in the equity (who collectively now own close to 25% of the float) who will help attract a ton of followership as this gets to merger. 

You can validate the data on your own looking at the institutional holdings tracked by Nasdaq or CapIQ.

Curiosity Stream is the love child of Netflix and Animal Planet, a streaming platform that exclusively caters to documentary and factual content. I'll give you the bullet points on why this company will grow into a streaming heavy hitter in the next 2 years:

\-they've doubled revenue year over year for the past 2 years and they project they will do it again in 2021 with profitability in 2022

\-13 million subs and climbing, they did not update this number after Covid hit and I suspect that they are growing much faster while keeping it quiet (9 different execs filed form 4's early November if you know what I mean) 

\-one of the highest retentions of subscribers in the industry, people love the price compared to the content offered and much more often purchase a yearly package instead of the monthly, that's 11 fewer chances to unsubscribe

\-partnership with TataSky (Indian cable company) projects 20 million new potential subscribers

\-non-fiction content is cheaper to make compared to scripted content, this gives the company an edge on production value and content investment

\-factual content is uniquely attractive to advertisers because of its family-friendly nature

\-stacked executive team full of industry connections, the founder is John Hendricks

\-Mkt Cap of 400mil that's projected to grow to 10 billion potentially

\-Analyst price targets are favorable

NFLX,"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",1605451463.0,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

**The Big Short**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.
* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.
* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.
* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24
* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

I'm not redoing this tonight. Fucking P/E, P/B and P/S ratios, graphs, and everything for you degenerates.

EDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:

First I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying ""bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg"", ur momma's a hoe.

Ok, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.

Then again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.

Anyways let's look at some price ratios:

* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.
* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.
* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.

Don't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.

Subsidiaries & Partnerships:

In a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:

* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.
* Qwest, subsidy.
* Prism TV, subsidy.
* Savvis, subsidy.
* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.
* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.
* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.
* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)

The list goes on and on.

New Market Enterprises:

The estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.

The aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me. At least this isn't a fucking mattress company.

NFLX,Autist's Gambit - Declined Variation [THANKSGIVING RESOLUTION],1606118325.0,"Many of the $NFLX permabulls, chess savants, and lazy-bum quarantine autists like myself have seen the newly released miniseries **Queen's Gambit**. For those of you who haven't heard of it yet, *Queen's Gambit* is set during the Cold War era, where orphaned chess prodigy **Beth Harmon** struggles with **addiction** in a quest to become the greatest chess player in the world.

[Elizabeth \\""Beth\\"" Harmon](https://preview.redd.it/zmngfzd64y061.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b27e24ffbc543296bc6e4891d0c5f19074a3811)

Congratulations, you've read this far. So you might be thinking: *""What the fuck does a queen and a gambit have to do with my autistic NIO-buying ass in a DD?""* Yes, I will begin to explain why watching this series has inspired me to change my entire trading strategy. If you can't see it yet, I don't blame you. You have to kind of be retarded to see the relationship here.

Beth was an **addict**. You are an **addict.**

Beth became good at chess when she freed herself of her **addiction.**

You can become good at trading if you free yourself of your **addiction.**

**Please stop yoloing fucking FDs**.

[Your addictions](https://preview.redd.it/hpgcpbt84y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=139c872572d592309adef5aeafa3076bfc845416)

Yes, I know. This is **Wall Street Bets.** But deep down, you are hurting, aren't you? You know that you aren't a real chad, and you are so beta that the covariance of your returns relative to the market is so much greater than the market variance. Day by day your losses repeat themselves, and all you want to do is to start seeing some green in your portfolio for Christmas season. Then you can get yourself a girlfriend so that you, your wife, your girlfriend, and your wife's boyfriend can start going on double dates instead of third wheeling all the time.

So this brings us to the question: ""***what should you do to start winning?""***

[Your portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/w72jbsia4y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7311d5b126d6039f99e0fc2ef7d0dfa4dc8aecf)

The answer is to start **selling options**. Imagine that for every loss you have ever incurred, your wife's boyfriend was on the opposite side of the trade, sniggering at you as you reach into your wife's purse to take our her credit card, deposit your funds into Robinhood, and purchase $NIO calls. He knows that $NIO calls are simply a means for you to transfer money into his pocket. He happily collects the premium that you just paid and drives off to Wendy's to collect his $4 for 4 happy meal. As he drives by, he sees a figure behind the dumpster, on his knees, and gives thanks to the lord that there exists a retard in this world that can feed him.

**CAN YOU NOT DESPISE THIS MAN? HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL! THIS COULD BE YOU!**

[Beth beats Borgov](https://preview.redd.it/2racqu7g4y061.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab08f4c47de45575f83f170483f4a891b8cb5479)

At the end of the series, Beth eventually takes down the Russian Grandmaster Borgov. I found this scene to be particularly insightful because it shows how one can overcome his/her addiction to eventually achieve true success. I encourage the members of WSB to take this Thanksgiving week to think about what their addictions are, and what steps they can take to achieve freedom.

How to go about these frequent changes this week would as always depend on both risk tolerance & account size.

* 25k plus individuals or CFD user will like always have life easy
* Non PDT Margin accounts could take advantage of the increased IV obtain some vertical credit spreads and let next week IV decline make you ton back while the stocks recover.
* Cash accounts, **specifically sub 5k**  should wait til later in the week when hopefully a determination has been made and IV falloff before getting an end of NOV or DEC contract. Otherwise incremental trades so you do not use up all your settled funds for the day.

NFLX,Background & Methodology to my Swing Trades - Discussion of TA tools & Risk Management,1604009063.0,"I made several post in regards to NIO, SNAP, PINS, & ETSY

I'm taking a noted look at QCOM, SQ, TWLO, & NFLX for next big blowups.

Feel free to look at my profile for the Discord [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM) or support me in general!

***It has helped many of you and I'm very proud and excited when I hear you're gain stories.  Feels good making a positive difference in someone else life!***

But I think it important to disclose my situation and why I'm so careful with my DD picks. For most in sub-reddit this is nothing more than a long text wall waste of time, but for you guys that use my research to assist in your gains I think it reassuring you knew somewhat who your taking advice from.

I been paper trading for months while trying to scrap some savings when I was unemployed from Jan to May.

After getting a job finally & saving up enough to payoff the past debt I racked up from the lock-down I started real trading in late August from my initial 2k made it to 8k until September slapped reality into me and ass fucked me back to $132 (welcome to REAL trading) and been carefully trading since and looking for what I did wrong. (Utilizing all my cash with no hedge for overnight holdings). Look at my post history when I started.

Also trading hard when you have a job and can't focus on the markets, you know how many opportunities I missed since mid-September since I couldn't execute a trade.

Point is I don't have a large account, hundreds of percent wins for you is literally hundreds of tendies for me. I getting there but I like to think just cause I have small dick doesn't mean I don't have a big brain or experience.

Anyway if you missed what I been posting before look up my post history also the answer to the common questions:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to remind everyone that got specific inquiries about a specific ticker or needs live updates to go to [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM)

1. **I simply cannot respond in a timely manner through Reddit, some you witness that today 😉**
2. **I want to assure you my DDs will still be posted in both WSB and the discord going forward.**

&#x200B;

**How are you so good and keenly accurate on your picks?**

\-Because I been looking up charts and scanning for similar patterns within a trend, reversal, and squeeze-to-breakout with the TA tools I use over and over again until muscle memory kicked in.

\-Also paper traded literally for months when I had nothing else to do.

&#x200B;

**What do you use for research?**

* The higher the time-frame the more you notice a more powerful move.

1. Anything up to 5 min. is good for scalping  think 2% moves kind of level
2. From there 10 min to 30 min is excellent for day trading, think along the lines of noticing when a stock moves 3 - 6%
3. Then we got the hourly's for Swing Trading from 1H (8-11%) to 2H (12-15%) & finally 4H (16+%) moves

* Oscillators are good at the determining rate of movements for units, whether they are overbought or oversold while in a range with decreasing momentum or IV or increasingly  ""sustained levels of velocity"" aka does it continuously hover at or above 80 overbought or  below 20 oversold  for example.
* All consolidation shows you is that the bears/bulls are becoming exhausted and cannot force the other to move. One about to get knocked out and other will be the winner. BB assist in this to show when implied volatility in the stock is decreasing and when someone going night-night. When there no resistance you get a breakout (volume profile too if you want to see session to session support & resistance aka when the fighters are the strongest. But that far more depth that will confuse a lot of people so I do not show it on the charts)
* Band Squeeze does not show directional movement though, RSI/STOCH & their variations do. Anytime the indicators hover near 30 or 70 show their directional bias period, anytime it hits 20 or 80 multiple times shows a ""trend"" , finally if it passes and ""sustain"" below/above the prior numbers shows increasing momentum, this can be backed up with the MACD histogram.
* MACD histogram- A sharp cross with the lines with a 90 degree angle shows a strong velocity move just occurred, the more spaced out the lines are in the same direction show the momentum increasing.
* Same with the histogram: The bigger the bars in succession the more velocity the move is and for me the best indication of potential transition to a strong momentum is when the lines are in tandem hugging the 0 line whether above or below is irrelevant. This is backed by the Bollinger bands again.
* Bollinger Bands- Just show IV, bigger they are the bigger the potential the movement both directions, when used with volume profile or a oscillator it very good at telling you if a movement is in a range (bouncing from top band to low band & vice versa). Trending (opening and closing near the band successive directional movement aka hugging) or breaking out (crosses or outright open outside the band while quickly accelerating away from the band so much so that the band simply goes vertical.

&#x200B;

All this combined leads to high prob. of a breakout or breakdown in whatever time-frame chosen, well at least for me anyway.

*You can always learn more at* [*https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start*](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start) *It free and plenty of explanation’s that go deeper than I ever could and plenty of examples.

**What the format of your risk management? What keeps you in the game?**

I position size on what I can afford to lose, meaning if I buy $500 in options it because that all willing to lose on that trade, this prevents me from having to worry about stop losses or need to hedge. There nothing wrong with these strategies but I see some flaws.

1. *Stops only work in current sessions where stock will move in a flow. Next day sessions risk GAP UP/DOWN that can cause the order to trigger at far worse point if it a market order or not at at all if it completely passes if it stop limit.*
2. *Next is hedging, the easiest way is spreads, or more specifically legging into a position to create a spread. That a far more detailed explanation that can be found in the resources below. Finally for whatever reason you cannot use spreads (cash accounts) you can always buy the opposite directional option in contrast to your position at no more than 1/3 the value of your original position. This will protect you from unexpected gaps or ""shock news"" by offsetting your losses til you can adjust your portfolio.*

*This is the only time in my opinion where it perfectly acceptable to use weeklies & FDs, to cheaply hedge & potentially recuperate your losses. I don't hate weeklies, just don't have time to trade them actively nor do most people utilize them correctly,* ***THEY ARE FOR SCALPING. NOT DAY TRADING.***

**\*I don't trade more than the principal balance @ start of week to prevent out-sized losses\***

<But you retards will do what you always do, I leave it at that>

**Do you hold through earnings?**

Usually not, I do Lotto plays though (no extrinsic value practically, but  very cheap OTM option that likely to become in the money, so I hope)

If it successful you get a couple hundred percent, if you let it ride throughout the day usually several thousand

**Do you hold through the weekends?**

Almost never, unless they're LEAPS and I'm confident in the long term trend.

Plus, it forces you to take profit at END OF WEEK and restart your principal balance.

&#x200B;

**Can you look at… When do you think it time to sell…. Will this keep going up?**

I'm picking up the when I'm comfortable with risk/reward ratio and STRONGLY suggest you use your position sizing and risk management rules aka do your own due diligence

The only reason I do these post is to give people a timely heads up when something big going to happen, THAT IT

I'm not going to go step by step explaining when I enter or exit. I'll post my profit target, position, and time horizon then it done. If I think something truly off I'll update the the DD (if it recent)"

NFLX,Netflix hiking his $13/mo plan to $14/mo,1604006011.0," 

Netflix (NASDAQ:[NFLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX?source=news_body_link)) has jumped 3.7% as it's set to implement an expected U.S. price increase, [bumping its most popular standard plan to $14/month](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features?source=news_body_link).

That's a dollar higher than its current $13 plan.

Accordingly  it's also moved its premium subscription (which allows for ultra  high-definition quality and four simultaneous streams) to $18/month. The  lowest tier is set to stay at $9/month.

The  new prices kick in immediately for new subscribers, while existing subs  will see the higher prices roll in with their billing cycles in coming  weeks.

Netflix raises prices on a  country-by-country basis, and says the hikes don't affect each other.  But observers who track the pace of increases were expecting Netflix  might act to raise U.S. prices early in 2021.

The  increase was signaled during last week's earnings call, when COO/Chief  Product Officer Greg Peters said ""You heard from Ted \[Sarandos\] the  number of original productions we're doing, increasing even under these  conditions ... if we do that, we feel like there is that opportunity to [occasionally go back and ask, for members where we've delivered that extra value in those countries to pay a little bit more](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3624015-netflix-call-subs-dipped-expected-production-full-steam-ahead-updated?source=news_body_link).""

A rise to $14/month puts Netflix's most popular  plan almost at parity with HBO Max ($15/month) - which launched at a  price point that some observers thought might be too much for a  streaming service.

NFLX,Is AMC the next GME?,1604001543.0,"I have no special insights or articles to post other than what we already know.

The latest rumor is that we may see a takeover attempt by AMZN or NFLX at some point. There is also the possibility of recovery IF we don't go into a hardcore 2nd lockdown.

Personally I feel like this is one to watch, but there is a very real chance they will file bankruptcy. With bankruptcy comes the possibility of a pop like we saw with HTZ. This would be very hard to time, but it's another option to consider.

Anyone smarter than me have better ideas or plays?"

INTC,"Sold UBER to buy INTC, AMA",1606191230.0,"Basically I have been holding Uber stock for less than a year but more than a week so the shares started to itch and I had to scratch them, sold 95% at 46.37 to buy intel at 44.99 (fucking blue chip value play bullshit I know, could have bought calls like a Chad ). So anyway I looked at the stonks after a few days of binge drinking with hookers, and waddya know, fucking Uber keeps on fucking mooning, past $50 now. Total rocket ship. 

And you know the best part? Looking back at the retards who told me, when I was buying around $26, that Uber was definitely going bankrupt, etc. Like these bro-king Tech Chads weren't going to Rockefeller the shit out of their bullshit monopoly and manipulate an election to keep making money. Truckloads of money. You know they barely even pay these Uber drivers a living wage, right? Wall Street loves this story. It's a badass story, and everyone likes it, actually. 

And yeah I'm a small timer, literally only had 20 shares. Not even worth the screenshot lol. But I have skills. I pick winners, and believe that I can do it again. Stay tuned for free dollars!"
INTC,Buy INTC Calls,1605028138.0,"Intel is the biggest chip maker in the world; their net income has increased every year, as has their shareholder's equity (not to mention their dividend). P/E is about 8, much lower than the market average. Also, the dividend is high which makes it attractive to boomers, as they will soon pour money into it. Competing companies earn much less money, have a much worse fundamentals, and will most definitely underperform compared to INTC. Technically, INTC has found support at a multi-year trend line, and this will cause the price the catapult.

So I know if stock goes up and down it affects the NASDAQ index, but somehow it works the otherway around aswell. Intel was at 3-4% green for a long time, but at the end of the day NASDAQ tanked and so did intel and AMD. How does the falling of big companies like FB and AAPL affect the stocks on AMD and INTC.

INTC,Intel Stock INTC,1605024636.0,"hi All,

Can anyone provide some insight onto the Intel stock price decline over the past few months? Is the 7nm production issue such a large concern to merit such a crash? Given the relative sizes of AMD and Intel, is the market right in comparing them both? It would take IMO a really long time for AMD to catch up to the kind of revenues Intel is making. Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?"

INTC,MRVL next great chip play,1606051877.0,"Ok so my first official DD but I’ve got some conviction around it so I thought I’d get the beautiful masses to opine

My thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:

1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets

2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That’s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players

3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. 

AND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. 

Here’s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:
Marvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message

4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. 


With earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it’s potential huge value that MRVL hasn’t run on. 

I’m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I’ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. 

100 12/11 46c
50 1/21/22 50c 

TLDR: buy MRVL. You’ll thank me later


Side note: I’m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I’d love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see."

INTC,Double down on intel?,1603820690.0,"So i did a cash flow analysis on intel back in may and saw a valuation of about 70, and so i purchased at 58.

INTC,Here’s how I will play the election.,1604197758.0,"
The bear is prob dancing in tendies last week. 
last 30 minute seems to be short covering. They will have the money to BTFD Monday. Tuesday likely to be a shit show. 

Everyone seems to be bearish, and when everyone is bearish the likely hood of crashing is low. The chances of rally is much higher.


According to Sam Stovall 


With 88% success rate

It works like this: If the S&amp;P 500 rises from August through October, the incumbent party (in this case, Republican—Trump) is reelected to the White House. If the S&amp;P 500 falls over the three-month stretch, the Oval Office flips to the opposing party (in this case, Democrat—Joe Biden).

The president predictor is suggesting that Biden is likely to win. 

Does that mean we will limit down like what happen with Obama? 

Here’s my Thoughts: 

There can be 3 possibilities:
1. SPY go up
2. SPY go down
3. SPY stays flat because who ever is president is priced in and the only person that matter is Powell. 

Plays:                                                                                

1:cash gang, doesn’t matter what happen you’ll get IV crush after election, of the 3 possibilities you lose 2/3, just take a week off and watch the week go to shit and play after the election. 

2:Play the IV, strangle/straddle/credit spreads

3:Long gold, silver and TLT doesn’t matter who wins, the printer will be turned on, stimulus will be back in discussion and will be pass soon after the election. 

Bonus: buy INTC 

But but AMD.... I get it But AMD is up 120% since last year. INTC is at 3 year support, the risk/reward for call leaps are huge. They still generate 70billion in revenue with extremely low PE ratio, and ceo has brought back more stocks.

Position: I mainly Cash gang but have a lotto position 
Playing with gold 


Good luck."

Cisco stock rallies more than 8% as results, outlook top Street view

Cisco Systems Inc. shares surged in the extended session Thursday after the maker of network services, videoconferencing tools and security software’s quarterly results and outlook topped Wall Street estimates, and it announced a new chief financial officer."

CSCO,Want to make money? Buy Dell,1606087017.0,"Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)

Now the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. 

Now I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!

But, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/

They have a 3 sections.

VMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.

I believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)

Also NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.

Now onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.

Now Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%

Also there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded

ORCL,What do ya'll think of ORCL?,1605504117.0,"It was recently just in the news about the US filing a 15 day extension for ORCL, WAL, and other investors to buy it. ORCL has the obvious mastery in the nuts and bolts of Tik Tok, which is data management and cloud work. Read this excerpt.

*  In Tuesday’s court filing, ByteDance said it submitted a fourth proposal last Friday that contemplated addressing U.S. concerns “by creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok’s U.S. user data and content moderation.” 

Since the new entity would mean that the US gets to own the user data (remember that the whole point of the trade war is that China was quote on quote stealing US data, lol). This would increase Oracle's value immensely, as it is a business deal closely related to working with the governments (smells kind of political) and to be able to wield TikTok in the American market would be comparable to the new snapchat or instagram or vine. It seems like a really great app (100 million users), and once hands transfer over to an American company (fingers crossed?) the tech market would probably be disrupted to some degree as well, as it's comparable to Facebook buying Instagram, which many people are pissed at for mishandling American's data....

Sunday eve I [posted my plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) for the week and opened those positions Monday morning. Sitting on about $4k profits which I've closed out some and may or may not let the others ride out for a few additional percentage points. Think I might take out your wife for some nice lobster and then to pound-town to finish off a good week. My next play is absolutely free money and literally wont go tits up.

**Weekend Plays**

CRM - Salesforce: 100 shares @ $237 cost basis. Currently $251 per share and 6% profit or $1,400.

DOCU: Sold 2x cash secured puts for $1,700 and closed them out this morning at $272 for $1,400 gain.

JD: Sold 2x CSP for $640. Up $400 and will let the rest ride.

PYPL: Sold 3x CSP for earnings and closed yesterday at $600 profit when the stock was flat in the morning.

These plays had minimal risk since the stocks would need to drop another 5-10% for me to be assigned. I knew mango man had my back and wouldn't let me down. Positions -Yes I'm using all the margin and buying power my account has to offer, but if I could use more I would since this put-selling is pretty fucking hard to fail at.

QCOM,What are your guys thoughts on QCOM?,1604594561.0,As the title says.
QCOM,Yall sleeping on Tim Apple - the next Tesla,1606046506.0,"Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards

So I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.

AAPL is the next TSLA.

TSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. 

""Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout."" 

""If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?"" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)

""This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?

""This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.""

Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all 🍎.

Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. 

Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.

Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Also AAPL finished an A, B, C correction? Some tard with more brain wrinkles can explain wave theory. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?

""I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tangent about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost""

Shrooms are fucking amazing.

Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?

""What will be the catalyst?"" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.

""But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-"" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.

I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. 
 
Positions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. [AAPL 11/27 125C](https://imgur.com/a/dIAeU6p). Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.

TL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust."

Not mention plenty of stocks that are on decline, but I like to focus on [SNAP](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oGX3nCJk/) & [PINS](https://www.tradingview.com/x/F4An7U2t/)

**Tools in use**: Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, Stochastic ([Please look at my main post to learn how I utilize them](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkjw5o/background_methodology_to_my_swing_trades/))

**Time Frame**\- 30 mins, any further is pointless for *day trading*

How to go about these frequent changes this week would as always depend on both risk tolerance & account size.

* 25k plus individuals or CFD user will like always have life easy
* Non PDT Margin accounts could take advantage of the increased IV obtain some vertical credit spreads and let next week IV decline make you ton back while the stocks recover.
* Cash accounts, **specifically sub 5k**  should wait til later in the week when hopefully a determination has been made and IV falloff before getting an end of NOV or DEC contract. Otherwise incremental trades so you do not use up all your settled funds for the day.

*Will begin to the use the* ***TradingView Ideas*** *format for future DDs, they will still be posted here though so no worries, unless MODs come with hammer, then worry!*

QCOM,Background & Methodology to my Swing Trades - Discussion of TA tools & Risk Management,1604009063.0,"I made several post in regards to NIO, SNAP, PINS, & ETSY

I'm taking a noted look at QCOM, SQ, TWLO, & NFLX for next big blowups.

Feel free to look at my profile for the Discord [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM) or support me in general!

***It has helped many of you and I'm very proud and excited when I hear you're gain stories.  Feels good making a positive difference in someone else life!***

But I think it important to disclose my situation and why I'm so careful with my DD picks. For most in sub-reddit this is nothing more than a long text wall waste of time, but for you guys that use my research to assist in your gains I think it reassuring you knew somewhat who your taking advice from.

I been paper trading for months while trying to scrap some savings when I was unemployed from Jan to May.

After getting a job finally & saving up enough to payoff the past debt I racked up from the lock-down I started real trading in late August from my initial 2k made it to 8k until September slapped reality into me and ass fucked me back to $132 (welcome to REAL trading) and been carefully trading since and looking for what I did wrong. (Utilizing all my cash with no hedge for overnight holdings). Look at my post history when I started.

Also trading hard when you have a job and can't focus on the markets, you know how many opportunities I missed since mid-September since I couldn't execute a trade.

Point is I don't have a large account, hundreds of percent wins for you is literally hundreds of tendies for me. I getting there but I like to think just cause I have small dick doesn't mean I don't have a big brain or experience.

Anyway if you missed what I been posting before look up my post history also the answer to the common questions:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to remind everyone that got specific inquiries about a specific ticker or needs live updates to go to [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM)

1. **I simply cannot respond in a timely manner through Reddit, some you witness that today 😉**
2. **I want to assure you my DDs will still be posted in both WSB and the discord going forward.**

&#x200B;

**How are you so good and keenly accurate on your picks?**

\-Because I been looking up charts and scanning for similar patterns within a trend, reversal, and squeeze-to-breakout with the TA tools I use over and over again until muscle memory kicked in.

\-Also paper traded literally for months when I had nothing else to do.

&#x200B;

**What do you use for research?**

* The higher the time-frame the more you notice a more powerful move.

1. Anything up to 5 min. is good for scalping  think 2% moves kind of level
2. From there 10 min to 30 min is excellent for day trading, think along the lines of noticing when a stock moves 3 - 6%
3. Then we got the hourly's for Swing Trading from 1H (8-11%) to 2H (12-15%) & finally 4H (16+%) moves

* Oscillators are good at the determining rate of movements for units, whether they are overbought or oversold while in a range with decreasing momentum or IV or increasingly  ""sustained levels of velocity"" aka does it continuously hover at or above 80 overbought or  below 20 oversold  for example.
* All consolidation shows you is that the bears/bulls are becoming exhausted and cannot force the other to move. One about to get knocked out and other will be the winner. BB assist in this to show when implied volatility in the stock is decreasing and when someone going night-night. When there no resistance you get a breakout (volume profile too if you want to see session to session support & resistance aka when the fighters are the strongest. But that far more depth that will confuse a lot of people so I do not show it on the charts)
* Band Squeeze does not show directional movement though, RSI/STOCH & their variations do. Anytime the indicators hover near 30 or 70 show their directional bias period, anytime it hits 20 or 80 multiple times shows a ""trend"" , finally if it passes and ""sustain"" below/above the prior numbers shows increasing momentum, this can be backed up with the MACD histogram.
* MACD histogram- A sharp cross with the lines with a 90 degree angle shows a strong velocity move just occurred, the more spaced out the lines are in the same direction show the momentum increasing.
* Same with the histogram: The bigger the bars in succession the more velocity the move is and for me the best indication of potential transition to a strong momentum is when the lines are in tandem hugging the 0 line whether above or below is irrelevant. This is backed by the Bollinger bands again.
* Bollinger Bands- Just show IV, bigger they are the bigger the potential the movement both directions, when used with volume profile or a oscillator it very good at telling you if a movement is in a range (bouncing from top band to low band & vice versa). Trending (opening and closing near the band successive directional movement aka hugging) or breaking out (crosses or outright open outside the band while quickly accelerating away from the band so much so that the band simply goes vertical.

&#x200B;

All this combined leads to high prob. of a breakout or breakdown in whatever time-frame chosen, well at least for me anyway.

*You can always learn more at* [*https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start*](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start) *It free and plenty of explanation’s that go deeper than I ever could and plenty of examples.

&#x200B;

**What the format of your risk management? What keeps you in the game?**

I position size on what I can afford to lose, meaning if I buy $500 in options it because that all willing to lose on that trade, this prevents me from having to worry about stop losses or need to hedge. There nothing wrong with these strategies but I see some flaws.

1. *Stops only work in current sessions where stock will move in a flow. Next day sessions risk GAP UP/DOWN that can cause the order to trigger at far worse point if it a market order or not at at all if it completely passes if it stop limit.*
2. *Next is hedging, the easiest way is spreads, or more specifically legging into a position to create a spread. That a far more detailed explanation that can be found in the resources below. Finally for whatever reason you cannot use spreads (cash accounts) you can always buy the opposite directional option in contrast to your position at no more than 1/3 the value of your original position. This will protect you from unexpected gaps or ""shock news"" by offsetting your losses til you can adjust your portfolio.*

*This is the only time in my opinion where it perfectly acceptable to use weeklies & FDs, to cheaply hedge & potentially recuperate your losses. I don't hate weeklies, just don't have time to trade them actively nor do most people utilize them correctly,* ***THEY ARE FOR SCALPING. NOT DAY TRADING.***

**\*I don't trade more than the principal balance @ start of week to prevent out-sized losses\***

<But you retards will do what you always do, I leave it at that>

**Do you hold through earnings?**

Usually not, I do Lotto plays though (no extrinsic value practically, but  very cheap OTM option that likely to become in the money, so I hope)

If it successful you get a couple hundred percent, if you let it ride throughout the day usually several thousand

**Do you hold through the weekends?**

Almost never, unless they're LEAPS and I'm confident in the long term trend.

Plus, it forces you to take profit at END OF WEEK and restart your principal balance.

&#x200B;

**Can you look at… When do you think it time to sell…. Will this keep going up?**

I'm picking up the when I'm comfortable with risk/reward ratio and STRONGLY suggest you use your position sizing and risk management rules aka do your own due diligence

The only reason I do these post is to give people a timely heads up when something big going to happen, THAT IT

I'm not going to go step by step explaining when I enter or exit. I'll post my profit target, position, and time horizon then it done. If I think something truly off I'll update the the DD (if it recent)"

Synaptics’ fortunes flagged in recent years, hurt by a drifting corporate mission and growing competition from Asia. Revenue in the June 2020 fiscal year was $1.33 billion, about 10% below the year-earlier level, marking the third straight year of declining revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $5.95 a share, up from $4 in fiscal 2019, reversing four consecutive years of declining profits.


2) Who is Michael Hurlston?

This savior became SYNA’s CEO about a year ago. When Michael Hurlston became CEO of Synaptics a year ago, the chip seller was a “bag of parts,” he says. “Job No. 1 was to make the most out of each part of the portfolio.”

Hurlston, 53, has done that, and more, chopping costs, shedding weak operations, making smart acquisitions, and burnishing the financial outlook of the San Jose, Calif.–based company, which makes components used in human-machine interface applications. So far, investors like what they see: Synaptics’ stock has rallied almost 150% in the past 12 months, reversing the prior four years’ losses. More gains could lie ahead, as Hurlston and his team continue to restructure and grow the business.

Hurlston seems a good choice to move things forward. Most recently he was CEO of Finisar, an optical-networking component company that he sold to II-VI for $3.2 billion within a year of his arrival. Before that, he was senior vice president for mobile, wireless, and connectivity products at Broadcom. More on that in a moment.

“When I arrived here, the company was undermanaged,” Hurlston said in a Zoom interview from his office. “There just wasn’t a lot of rigor around anything we did—no regular engineering reviews, or budget reviews, or general tracking of progress.”

Hurlston restructured the product portfolio, selling a business that makes integrated touch and display chips for LCD phones to a Chinese private-equity firm. Most high-end phones now use OLED displays, with LCDs used primarily in lower-end devices, he noted. Competition was fierce, and margins were ebbing.

Two acquisitions then followed, both closing in July. Synaptics bought DisplayLink, a Palo Alto–based company with a lock on the market for components used in universal docking stations, for $305 million in cash. “They’re the only company that has been able to figure this out,” Hurlston said.

The transaction was immediately accretive to earnings.

Synaptics also spent $250 million for Broadcom’s wireless Internet of Things business, which includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS technologies. Hurlston knew that business intimately: He used to run it. “We felt like there were a lot of places where we needed wireless assets,” he said, citing video and audio products and wireless docking stations. “It’s a deal that only we could have done. My old team was involved, and some of them came over here.”

He sees applications in wearables, surveillance cameras, and video set-top boxes.


3) Valuation?

At a recent $78~/share, Synaptics trades for just over two times estimated revenue and less than 13 times expected profit for the June-2021 fiscal year. Competitors, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and Microchip Technology (MC HP ), fetch five to 10 times current-year revenue, suggesting Synaptics is underappreciated in every sense of the word.

Furthermore, when SYNA beat their numbers in the last earnings call (and raised Q1 guidance), the stock jumped significantly and briefly touched 52 week high ($90~/share) before the stock retreated along with the market over the last 3 months. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about this company’s future prospects. They purchased IoT portfolio from Broadcom (AVGO) and they are focusing on high margin segments and once again, this stock is ripe for another beat when they report on Nov 5th. It is not out of the question that the stock will continue to march over the next 12 months and if you missed out on AMD/NVDA and other semiconductor play, this is the stock that you have been looking for.

Lastly, per Michael Hurlston who has a track record of turning around companies like Finisar, Synaptics had become a “$1 billion revenue company in the body of a $2 billion revenue company,” with an inefficient structure. For example, its PC business had a core design center in Taiwan’s capital city of Taipei, and offices in Armenia; Hyderabad, India; and the U.S. He closed all but the Taipei office, located near PC design operations for customers HP Inc. and Dell. “I did that kind of thing across the business,” he said. The result: Quarterly operating expenses fell to about $80 million from $110 million, and head count dropped to 1,200 from 1,700.

Meanwhile, Synaptics’ gross profit margins have risen in the past year to nearly 50% from under 40%. The company is configured, he says, to grow revenue in the 4% to 6% range, with profits rising faster as margins expand. Analysts expect Synaptics to earn $6.49 a share this year on revenue of $1.3 billion. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh thinks that earnings could top $8 a share in fiscal 2022. The stock “looks inexpensive with multiple ways to outperform,” he recently wrote.

4) Street Coverage

Paul Wick, a portfolio manager with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, owns more than 10% of Synaptics’ shares in the Columbia Seligman Communications & Information fund (SLMCX), which he has run for more than 30 years. He’s a big Hurlston fan, and has been impressed with the new focus on growth and operating efficiency. Wick recalls how Hurlston was astonished by the huge number of fabs and test and assembly houses Synaptics was using. “They weren’t getting volume discounts from anyone,” Wick says. “They were able to reduce the number of vendors and get better pricing.”

SAP,SAP Shares Collapse After Lockdowns Force Cuts to Revenue,1603716317.0,"Good sobering reminder that tech is not ""immune"" from Covid

* * *

SAP SE shares dropped as much as 21%, the biggest intraday fall since 1999, after the software company cut its revenue forecast for the full year and said it expects a fresh wave of lockdowns to hurt demand through the first half of 2021.

In a test for Christian Klein, who became sole chief executive officer in April, the pandemic will delay SAP’s goals for cloud revenue, overall sales and operating profit by one or two years, especially in hard-hit industries such as business travel, the Walldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement on Sunday. The drop in shares on Monday wiped 28 billion euros ($33.1 billion) off SAP’s market value.

The drop-off in SAP’s cloud revenue is a sign that companies are putting off making major decisions about updating their software, as the pandemic continues to limit any global economic recovery.

SAP said it expects limited growth and margin improvement over the next two years, and moved expectations to meet its 2023 strategy plan out to 2025. Klein said on a call Monday he expects a conservative recovery into the first half of next year.

The previous outlook “assumed economies would reopen and population lockdowns would ease, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarters,” SAP said in the statement. “Lockdowns have been recently re-introduced in some regions and demand recovery has been more muted than expected.”

The pessimistic short-term outlook from SAP risked a knock-on effect on the European software industry, warned analysts at Citi. Europe’s Stoxx Technology index fell as much as 6.3%, its biggest one-day loss since March.

SAP now expects adjusted revenue of 27.2 billion euros to 27.8 billion euros ($32.2 billion to $32.9 billion) at constant currencies in 2020, lower than the earlier guidance of 27.8 billion euros to 28.5 billion euros. SAP also said it no longer sees a boost from business-travel related revenue this year in its Concur business.

It’s difficult to find positive news in the results, Nicholas David, an analyst at Oddo BHF said Monday. “The warning on the mid-term ambitions was expected/feared by the market but the new ambitions are lower than the most pessimistic expectations,” he said in a note.

Qualtrics IPO

SAP said it is in the advanced stages of a listing for its Qualtrics software unit. It announced the decision in July to list the U.S. unit less than two years after buying the company for a record sum, a surprise u-turn signaling a strategic shift under Klein.

“We are well advanced in the preparations of the Qualtrics IPO”, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said on a call Monday. “Qualtrics has had a strong quarter which will set it up for further growth into next year.”

New Outlook

Adjusted cloud revenue is expected to be 8 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros in 2020, down from a previous estimate of 8.3 billion euros to 8.7 billion euros.Operating profit will be 8.1 billion euros to 8.5 billion euros this year, down from expectations of as much as 8.7 billion euros.SAP updated its mid-term ambition for total revenue to more than 36 billion euros in 2025 compared to its previous estimate of 35 billion euros in 2023.The company sees more than 22 billion euros in cloud revenue and over 11.5 billion euros in operating profit by 2025.

Third Quarter

Third quarter non-IFRS operating profit decreased by 12% year over year to 2.07 billion euros. That compared to the 2.15 billion-euro average estimate from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Revenue in the period declined 4% to 6.54 billion euros compared to analysts’ average 6.89 billion euro estimate.

SAP,S&P Exclusion Play,1605794163.0,"Tesla is joining the s&p 500 and I wish to celebrate it giving into my homosexual impulses for a trade or two.

This means one unlucky company will be dropped from the top 500 index. I can think of 10 companies which are good candidates for exclusion, which pretty much ensures a drop in stock price.

Oil/Gas/Legacy Industry (makes sense with EV inclusion)
- $MRO too hyped, may not be it, but it's the worse company in the index according to s&p own acceptance parameters
- $NOV losing cash left and right
- $DVN bad few past quarters
- $FANG they're losing so much cash!

Sucker Tech
- $DXC cash sink, their business practises and tech stack are antiquated, may just as well be bought by Accenture/SAP and the likes
- $XRX wouldn't that be fun

Manufacturing (it's dead in the usa - however unlikely due to touchy feely we-don't-want-to-get-ahead-of-the-market s&p board approach. Pretty sure they will bend the rules to accomodate for murican nationalist sentiment and keep these in)
- $LEG main division is office supplies which will be bleeding for the foreseeable future
- $TPR luxury items design house, eh

I will also throw in a airline and cruise line to round up to 10, would make sense notwithstanding daddy government throwing your hard earned capital gain taxes at them every chance they can get:
$ALK & $NCLH - both unlikely but frankly warranted. 

I am a gambling man, and I bet Oil/Gas/Exploration are the most likely to get the boot. The 4 I mentioned have the worse financials of all, and all macros suggest things won't be getting better for the sector as a whole.

Tread lightly, but if you're a bear like me, an occasion like this comes too rarely to pass."

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Apple 2003 [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

ZM,"Which one of you got put in charge of the largest U.S Pension? CALPERS buys hundreds of thousands of shares in NKLA, NIO, and ZM",1605477486.0,"The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

ZM,$DOCU is outperforming $ZM by 20% this month. Is that fair or is that just because $DOCU is less famous?,1605712313.0,"The vaccine trade was easy to understand. With 95% effectiveness, market now believes more people will be returning to office sooner or later. WFH names like $ZM gets sold off, a 30% tumble month to date. In October I wrote a DD arguing why $ZM's valuation was too much. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcdsnq/zoom\_to\_the\_doom\_why\_long\_zm\_has\_become\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcdsnq/zoom_to_the_doom_why_long_zm_has_become_a/) The bulls hated me for that. Now in retrospect, **it was kinda obvious, wasn't it**?

But $ZM's other less famous WFH cousins, for example, $DOCU, only got sold off 9% this month. In case you have never heard of $DOCU, it is a company providing e-signature solutions. When the pandemic prevents people from meeting and signing in person, $DOCU benefited from strong demand for e-signature and remote signing. The two stocks $ZM and $DOCU have had strongly positive correlations. One goes up, the other goes up too. **Until now.**

Since the vaccine news came out, the performances start to drift, **with $DOCU now outperforms $ZM by 20% on the month**. Ok, another thing beyond my understanding happened. So **when the narrative of ""returning to office"" can hurt video conferencing business by almost 30%, it only hurts e-signature by 9%?** **So when people stop video conferencing and meet in person, they will still be signing electronically?** Hmm, I don't understand this. I mean **if you are now meeting in person already, why would you still have to sign electronically?** Isn't it easier to grab a pen and just do it than turning on your laptop, open a PDF file, then type?

Are there any corporate news coming out this month that strongly favors $DOCU?: **No I dont see any.** Maybe you care share with us if you have any insights.

Is it because $ZM was overvalued more and $DOCU was fair valued, so now $ZM drops more?: I don't think so. At this moment **$ZM is trading at forward P/E of 150.07 and $DOCU is trading at 312.31** (Bloomberg data). $DOCU's forward P/E is twice that of $ZM. If anything $ZM is a more mature company than $DOCU.

So what is the reason then? **Personally I think it is simply because fewer people know $DOCU.** When the vaccine news came out, everybody rushed to sell $ZM. And for $DOCU, what is that? Never heard of that.

**My position: Pair trade of long $ZM and short $DOCU. I am not bullish on $ZM. This is a pair trade betting their performance to converge.**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.
* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.
* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24
* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

[Q3 ER](https://ir.lumen.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Lumen-Technologies-Inc-Q3-2020-Earnings/default.aspx)

I  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward. Additionally,  with further lockdowns on the horizon, we should start to see this equity continue to pick up traction, think NFLX, ZM, etc.

[In ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)[fact, this report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the CAGR of  Fiber Optics and IT solutions will grow at a 15% rate by 2025. ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)

Positions: 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c

These contracts are dirt cheap folks, all under a buck as it stands right now. Let Dr. Michael Burry do you and your portfolio a favor and hop on the Tendie Train.

TL;DR: LUMN 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to mention that they recently announced 2 large Veteran's Affairs Contracts, one being a $795 million National Local Exchange Carrier Next Generation contract and a $195 million Data and Wide Area Network Carrier contract.

EDIT 2 11/21 20:17 CST: Jesus fuck it's Saturday don't you degenerates ever go outside? Well, I guess since this has gained some traction hasn't it boys?

I'll post some additional information tomorrow to address some of the comments and questions below. I can't do that shit tonight, I have a date with u/DonaldJTrumpsGhost's wife.

EDIT 3: FUCK ME 2 HOURS INTO THIS UPDATE AND REDDIT TAKES A SHIT.

I'm not redoing this tonight. Fucking P/E, P/B and P/S ratios, graphs, and everything for you degenerates.

EDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:

First I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying ""bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg"", ur momma's a hoe.

Ok, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.

Then again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.

Anyways let's look at some price ratios:

* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.
* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.
* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.

Don't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.

Subsidiaries & Partnerships:

In a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:

* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.
* Qwest, subsidy.
* Prism TV, subsidy.
* Savvis, subsidy.
* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.
* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.
* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.
* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)

The list goes on and on.

New Market Enterprises:

The estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.

The aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me. At least this isn't a fucking mattress company.

Go long. Mitigate your risk. **TAKE PROFITS.** Do your own DD. I'll meet you degenerates in Tendie Town."
ZM,Microsoft Cloud Partner Play: APXT and AvePoint Merger,1606261739.0,"Leading **Microsoft Corporation** Cloud partner AvePoint is set to go public with a SPAC deal announced Monday.

**The SPAC Deal:** AvePoint [will go public](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger) via **Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The deal values the company at $2 billion.

**What does AvePoint do?** AvePoint migrates, manages, and protects data in Microsoft 365.

**Management with Notable Credentials:** Apex Technology is led by former **Oracle Corporation** CFO **Jeff Epstein** (Unfortunate Name) and Brad Koenig, the former Head of Technology Investment Banking at **Goldman Sachs**.

Epstein [helped ](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/08/15/ex-oracle-cfo-plans-to-shop-for-a-tech-company.html)Oracle complete over 20 acquisitions including the $8.5 billion purchase of BEA Systems and the $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems.

Koenig helped on 42 technology IPOs in 1999 that raised $9.6 billion. He was also part of the team that brought **Alphabet Inc** to market in a $1.7 billion IPO. 

**Growth Potential According to AvePoint:** AvePoint believes it has an addressable market size of $33 billion by 2022.

AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.

Of 212 public software companies, AvePoint joins a select group that has revenue of $150 million in 2020, year-over-year revenue growth of 25% or more, and EBIT margins of 10% or more.

The five companies in the group are **Atlassian Corporation** (NASDAQ: [TEAM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TEAM)), **RingCentral** (NYSE: [RNG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RNG)), **ServiceNow** (NYSE: [NOW](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NOW)), **ZoomInfo Technologies** (NASDAQ: [ZI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZI)), and **Zoom Video Communications** (NASDAQ: [ZM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZM)).

Each of the five companies in the select group is up more than 80% in 2020, with ZoomInfo seeing a strong 2020 IPO and Zoom Video up more than 500% on the year.

**Financials:** AvePoint is estimating revenue to grow 26% year-over-year to $148 million for fiscal 2020.

The company is forecasting revenue to hit $193 million and $257 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, respectively. AvePoint is increasing its recurring revenue, providing predictable forecasting for its financial estimates.

**Why should you buy?** 

* Microsoft Office 365 has a worldwide market share of 41.59%, and Microsoft Powerpoint with 5.06%, for a combined **46.65%**. (Google leading with 50.59%)
* AvePoint is in presence with companies like **Atlassian Corporation**, **RingCentral**, **ServiceNow,** **ZoomInfo Technologies**, and **Zoom Video Communications.** (The 5 companies mentioned combined have an average price of: $**297**).
* Stock Price is $10.87 currently. (Minimal Risk, if merger fails, you get $10 per share back.)

**Position:** 50 Shares at 10.50.

***Why only 50 shares?*** I'm 18 and broke, so instead of using this money for something like a PlayStation or Macbook, I would rather invest it and hopefully double/triple/quadruple my money. 

***HOPEFULLY APXT HITS $20 AND UP BEFORE BOXING DAY.***

***DISCLAIMER: I'M A RETARDED 18 YEAR OLD, DON'T TAKE THIS POST TOO SERIOUSLY, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ETC. SORRY IF THE POST IS BADLY FORMATTED/BORING, THIS IS MY VERY FIRST POST ON WSB.*** 

TLDR: BUY APXT, MINIMAL RISK, DATA MANAGEMENT FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE, GROWTH POTENTIAL IS THERE. 

TLDR FOR AUTISTS: CANNOT GO TITS UP."

ZM,Election Week Predictions,1604208676.0,"I have been analyzing the past 5 election cycles and there has been a prevailing pattern that occurs every election week. On the day before every election, the market rallies (with an exception for the 2008 election, although the Dow jones was only down .06 %).

From 2004-2016, there has been an interesting pattern. Not to sound like a political hack, but in the past 4 election cycles, the market rallies after a Republican victory and dips after a Democratic victory. But /u/SyanWilmont, what about the 2000 election? [Remember retards, the 2000 election was very controversial because Floridaman both sucks at voting and sucks at counting.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) After the 2000 election, Florida reported a margin of victory of less than 0.5% for Bush. Due to the uncertainty of who won in 2000, the market decides to dip. This is an important lesson to learn since this election will be very controversial. If there is no clear winner reported by Tuesday, expect the election to be contested in the same way as the 2000 election and therefore a blood red Tuesday. 

Circling back to what happens to the market if a Democrat/Republican wins, if Trump wins the election, expect a small rally on Wednesday since 1) the market likes a Republican victory and 2) we will have more of the same, something that the market likes: stability. However, if Biden wins, expect the market to dip. Like I said, I’m not trying to be a political hack here, but based on the recent election cycles, a market dip always following a Democratic victory. To add more fuel to the fire, we all KNOW that Trump will NOT take the news of his defeat well at all. In my opinion, Biden barely winning the election is the worse case scenario for everyone in the short term. Republicans will absolutely contest the results of the election and Trump will not go down without a massive fight. In this scenario, stocks WILL go way down until after inauguration day, and even then I believe we will have civil unrest for a good while (Civil War 2 anybody?) However if Biden wins in a landslide, we will still experience a dip according to past market data. Of course, Trump and co will be angry but it’ll definitely be not catastrophic as the “Biden barely winning” scenario. 

Regardless of who wins, I still expect the market to dip as the week continues. US COVID cases are rising and the Europoors are locking down. Play this week very carefully guys.

TLDR: SELL EOD MONDAY, Cashgang/Beargang rest of the week. [Here is a pretty chart of how I think this week will go.]( https://i.ibb.co/RjJbvsR/2020electionweek.png)"

Not to mention ZM, PRPL, fucking GME. We have been literally feeding you positions that are easily 1000%+ return. Even if you are a boring old r/investing boomer who bought stocks, that still would've netted you over 100%. Not to mention other non-meme blue chips AAPL, MSFT, AMZN.

Ok retards, it’s me again. So I guess you miss my last post? I am a good person so here is the link. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvxjpu/cinemarks_cnk_free_tendies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

You know in life there is thing thats isn’t logic but in the end logic always win. So as you can see in the little picture, this is the most no sense shit the market have ever seen. Also, as you can see in your robinhoodautistapp these two stocks have the same YTD performance. This my friend, is insane. We have a bankrupt company VS a company that continue to make tendies even with low attendees and will survive easily the Chinese virus.

The problems is ROBINHOOD DEGENERATE THINK THAT CNK IS THE SAME SHIT AS AMC. Smart money/MM know that it isn’t the case, you still have the chance to save your account! Please my friend transfer all your cash, shares, call, whatever you have in AMC to CNK. You will thanks me later!

I could have added bear gang but we all know they don't need help getting out of the closet.

So, lets talk WuFlu. The numbers we've seen in the past few weeks have absolutely obliterated all previous records with the introduction of sustained cold weather for the first time since we all hunkered down and put $10k on SPY 200P 4/20. Jpow rammed his fat printing cock up all our asses and we screamed in glee and agony; confused by the pleasure of getting the money fucked out of us.

A lot of bulls got a taste of the forbidden fruit, they wondered if they might also be a little bit bear inside. But as soon as Jpow finished blowing his first load, all the bulls loaded up on TSLA weeklies hundreds of dollars OTM, desperate to ride that cock rocket to the moon. Quick! they said, AMZN 2200c 6/4! ZM 250C 7/17! Screaming 'daddy yes!' as they desperately clung to the throbbing veins of Jerome's phallic federal fury.

Yes, they got tendies, and yes the bears may even be asexual now, too afraid to even take a position in fear of the mighty jpow raw-dogging. But what does that say about you, bulls? Are you ready to embrace that you might even be gayer than the bears? Has Jerome pushed you so hard that you're the sub and you don't even know?

Food for thought. I am actually interested to know what all you homos think is going to happen. If current trends continue, we're well over 300k cases a day by Christmas. You know the current administration is gonna let it all burn to hurt the new administration. I'm not sure they will pass a stimulus for the general population. They might for select businesses though, with a tiny little nugget for the rest of us gambling addicts.

Who will be the losers then and who will be the winners? No wrong answers, you're all fuckin gay."

I Am unemployed unable to find job for 3-4Months now and just a regular guy trying to make some decent cash just to buy some food. 

l always got played by the market time and time again and I tried almost everything l know. Just why do l keep Messing up trades...sell low buy high is my expertise 

Recently i bought this shit “ZOOM 300P 11/20 bought it at 1.20 and now its worth 0.45, 

Need some solid advice like should i hold and hopefully ZM crashes and earn some cash 
or sell at open hoping for a little cash back?"
ZM,Disney Puts??,1605548730.0,"I know betting agains't the mouse is ill advised but come on, this is ridiculous, Disney is trading at almost ATH, its worth more right now than before the pandemic and most of its parks aren't even open....

Am I missing something?? Seems like it wouldn't take much for this stock to get spooked in the next few weeks given we're at the beginning of a serious 2nd wave.

I also picked up some zoom shares hoping this is a dip. After Thanksgiving I'm betting zoom rallies and covid sensitive stocks like theatres, airlines and entertainment tank again.

Positions:  
DIS 12/18 $125P  
DIS 1/15 $125P  
AMC 11/27 $3.5P (been holding this one for a while, but shoulda sold when it was up 90% lol)

**Time Frame**\- 30 mins, any further is pointless for *day trading*

How to go about these frequent changes this week would as always depend on both risk tolerance & account size.

* 25k plus individuals or CFD user will like always have life easy
* Non PDT Margin accounts could take advantage of the increased IV obtain some vertical credit spreads and let next week IV decline make you ton back while the stocks recover.
* Cash accounts, **specifically sub 5k**  should wait til later in the week when hopefully a determination has been made and IV falloff before getting an end of NOV or DEC contract. Otherwise incremental trades so you do not use up all your settled funds for the day.

*Will begin to the use the* ***TradingView Ideas*** *format for future DDs, they will still be posted here though so no worries, unless MODs come with hammer, then worry!*

Therapeutics working? Regeneron preventing hospitalizations? Is that why Zoom (ZM), Amwel (AMWL), teladoc (TDOC), Dominos (DPZ)are down? Maybe, but shouldn’t VNO, JBLU (and other airlines/real estate companies) be up? Why are they getting crushed too (other than me owning them). Don’t tell me, “People are holding cash to wait and see what happens.” Someone’s right and someone’s wrong. Either we are reopening everything soon or we are going to continue as is and Zoom and stay at home plays are going to rip higher, or, people are going back to NYC. 

2) Gaming
I told you hoes to buy Sony, it’s still a buy. They are allowed to sell image sensors to Huawei and PS5 fucks. India is getting into gaming too, demand going to skyrocket. Also, can someone please explain what Unity does and if NVIDIA is going to be the Netflix of video games? Too many consoles. And on the gaming note, for cell phone FPS, can we just get a controller to plug into a smart phone? Is it too embarrassing/clunky to have? Fuck it, I’ll just watch Doctor Disrespect on my phone (Halloween Costume of the year for sure). 

3) Fastly is down the shitter. 
Does Cathy Woods still have it? And, if you really think Biden will win and let Xi have America (Publicly v. Privately if Sun King wins), that means they can do business with tik tok again and you’d have to like it’s price point, no?

4) Costco, Walmart, Target are Always slammed. I walk by the parking lots (like a plebe) during the week to get lunch and they are always packed. Even on weekdays. Only Costco and Walmart excite me. Walmart for untapped tech potential (if you believe they’ll get tik tok) and Costco bc, well, Chickenbake. Costco has self checkout now so that’s going to be a fucking nightmare."

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

SHOP,Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box,1606175395.0,"I asked you guys what company you wanted me to do a valuation on and PLTR was the favorite. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.

&#x200B;

* Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients
* PLTR has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government, particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military
* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients
* With  \~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future  opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a  binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook, and  as a result, valuation, significantly

**Company Background and Summary:** Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**  controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a  partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,  existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a  one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which  will be key in its growth as a company.

PLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.

**Gotham:** Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute responses.

**Foundry:** This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily targeted to commercial customers.

Despite having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC) has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019. The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR  platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,  integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,  enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \~AI\~ among others.

The revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year 2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this  revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**  – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131  at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and  operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual  for a company in high growth mode.

**Palantir’s Business Model:** PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long, with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running. Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.

&#x200B;

[Source: Company Q3 presentation](https://preview.redd.it/ircmb18ts2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=323cabade8b9de9f729a53bfa1fd12db81813be2)

Acquire – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in  revenue in a calendar year. 

Expand – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having negative contribution margin throughout the same period. 

Scale – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy. Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.

**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:** Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and government sectors. 

Company management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9zd99daws2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b543896f77f55f1cc3e3c82be6f3beca58dbbcbc)

For government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market. 

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/dxbndfxys2161.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bce1a47f32cda8adb9a74854f7c9b32dadf98af1)

Sell-side estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down  methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to  Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM  levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.

**Government services:** Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In 1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme for future  cross-selling opportunities.

Government contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent potential upside to our estimates.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9i0a4a1t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07f9fb6ee9224b06f32347b8c5545038ef3896e

**Commercial services:** In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.

With ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity, but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater  than 20% of total commercial revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h8jlnnc3t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3275a383450ac8822c322fe5d00da3369b94ddfe

While the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a few contracts per quarter and year. 

https://preview.redd.it/5h7ycrw4t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35cf55a824c910ae8ffb748559926c05697d09ff

**Quarterly Earnings recap:** Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019. Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter. 

The company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market  fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these  solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers  in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a  not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a  customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be  crucial in diversifying the customer base.

Adjusted operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force and account management teams.

&#x200B;

**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:** Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates. Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a premium.  

[This was post-IPO and no longer relevant](https://preview.redd.it/zvcvqy7at2161.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=17814d0426eff732ccde8e905a09c87a58ccfc5f)

 For core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake). Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV / Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the total of both trading multiples.

However, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.

&#x200B;

[Source: Bloomberg consensus estimates](https://preview.redd.it/bj7ymy0dt2161.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=112c1731a3ca94897cbc4a396eb939cecbb0d0fa)

 These two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue  visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does  the stock deserve its premium?

**Valuation:** We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in 2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.

We lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:

* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025
* Avg.  Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.  From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e
* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter
* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter
* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex
* Free  Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth  software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS  multiples

[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/qslg362gt2161.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=6db3e44a12e60e36a8daf4a9f279a6f97286cfa1)

 For purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from  customers has a very large effect on the calculation. 

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/1nk201fjt2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bbdca6264611efa69c1a89eac19d975ba6331e)

 Then, depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on  different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range  of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \~$3 to the stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin similarly adds  \~$3. 

&#x200B;

**Key Risks:** Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.** 

Customer concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.

Competition is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools from other software companies outside of PLTR.

&#x200B;

Recent and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in  significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20  and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing  this decline. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t95bqxxot2161.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1bc01dd969fd556d3413d69c3934a76592f62d

Palantir is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical  quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more  information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of  the business appropriately. 

**Key catalysts:**

Increased commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In  addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability  than we have currently modeled.

The company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.

**TLDR;** Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play. Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.

* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

SHOP,Can We Save AMC?,1604374722.0,"AMC is currently trading at $2.15 and on the verge of [bankruptcy](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/amc-seeks-stock-sale-to-raise-50-million-to-stave-off-bankruptcy.html).  They are selling 20 million class A shares to secure $50 million in new capital, which I imagine is a hard sell with the prospect of Biden.  Last month, they warned investors that it could file for Chapter 11, which can make common stock worthless but allow them to keep operating.  AMC currently has 52m outstanding shares and 22m short.

AMC is the [leading cinema circuit](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188565/north-american-movie-theater-circuits-by-number-of-screens/) by number of screens in the United States & Canada.  Although occupancy is limited to 20-40% depending upon the region, movie theaters are accustomed to lower occupancy.  The main threat is a lack of of major films because this reduces demand.  Films like James Bond, originally set to [release](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54396415) April 2020 was moved back to November 2020.  It has once again been moved back to April 2021.

However, Governor Cuomo opened New York State two weeks ago and AMC CEO said “The news from Governor Cuomo on Saturday was a monumental step forward for the cinema industry”.  Whether AMC can survive or not until major blockbusters return will determine if they go bankrupt.  [CEO interview Oct 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z-xCD-Shqo)

Whether AMC files for bankruptcy or not, they have plans to continue operating.  Part of this plan has been implementing the [AMC Safe & Clean Protocols](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2020/AMC-Theatres-Crosses-the-1000000-Attendance-Mark-in-the-United-States-Since-Reopening-on-August-20-More-Than-4000000-Moviegoers-Have-Returned-to-All-AMC-owned-Theatres-Globally-Since-Reopening/default.aspx).  ""AMC also announced that in surveys of returning U.S. guests, its guest scores for theatre cleanliness hit all-time highs, considerably beating by a wide margin all previous theatre cleanliness scores, which have been tracked by AMC through surveys for decades. AMC attributed this marked rise in cleanliness to its new AMC Safe & Clean protocols. Social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, the easy availability of disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer, etc..""

Summary:

The market clearly believes AMC is going bankrupt, but what if they don't?  9 weeks ago AMC was $7.00.  If AMC manages to stay out of bankruptcy, 18 JUN 21 or 21 JAN 22 $5-8 calls can be acquired for $.30-$.50 each.  Since this is simply a bet that depends on AMC not going bankrupt, legging in would make the most sense.  Start with 18 JUN 21 $7 calls for $.30.  If Biden is elected, I want to see if AMC reacts negatively before adding more.  Work up to 150 $7 calls and if AMC returns to $20, enjoy your $200k for $3500 risk.  Or lose everything because they went bankrupt.  Who gives a shit.  Collectively buy thousands, force market makers long, squeeze shorts, save cinema industry.

Certainly the growth they saw last quarter was accentuated by COVID, but I think a lot of the transition from brick and mortar to online storefronts is permanent, and won't go back even after COVID is under more control.

Is Shopify a HOLD, BUY, or SELL, in your opinions? Is the company deploying its cash well to continue their growth and improve their product, or are they just hoping to increase market penetration with their current product?"

SHOP,Microsoft Cloud Partner Play: APXT and AvePoint Merger,1606261739.0,"Leading **Microsoft Corporation** Cloud partner AvePoint is set to go public with a SPAC deal announced Monday.

**The SPAC Deal:** AvePoint [will go public](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger) via **Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The deal values the company at $2 billion.

**What does AvePoint do?** AvePoint migrates, manages, and protects data in Microsoft 365.

**Management with Notable Credentials:** Apex Technology is led by former **Oracle Corporation** CFO **Jeff Epstein** (Unfortunate Name) and Brad Koenig, the former Head of Technology Investment Banking at **Goldman Sachs**.

Koenig helped on 42 technology IPOs in 1999 that raised $9.6 billion. He was also part of the team that brought **Alphabet Inc** to market in a $1.7 billion IPO. 

**Growth Potential According to AvePoint:** AvePoint believes it has an addressable market size of $33 billion by 2022.

AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.

Of 212 public software companies, AvePoint joins a select group that has revenue of $150 million in 2020, year-over-year revenue growth of 25% or more, and EBIT margins of 10% or more.

The five companies in the group are **Atlassian Corporation** (NASDAQ: [TEAM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TEAM)), **RingCentral** (NYSE: [RNG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RNG)), **ServiceNow** (NYSE: [NOW](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NOW)), **ZoomInfo Technologies** (NASDAQ: [ZI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZI)), and **Zoom Video Communications** (NASDAQ: [ZM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZM)).

**Financials:** AvePoint is estimating revenue to grow 26% year-over-year to $148 million for fiscal 2020.

The company is forecasting revenue to hit $193 million and $257 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, respectively. AvePoint is increasing its recurring revenue, providing predictable forecasting for its financial estimates.

**Why should you buy?** 

* Microsoft Office 365 has a worldwide market share of 41.59%, and Microsoft Powerpoint with 5.06%, for a combined **46.65%**. (Google leading with 50.59%)
* AvePoint is in presence with companies like **Atlassian Corporation**, **RingCentral**, **ServiceNow,** **ZoomInfo Technologies**, and **Zoom Video Communications.** (The 5 companies mentioned combined have an average price of: $**297**).
* Stock Price is $10.87 currently. (Minimal Risk, if merger fails, you get $10 per share back.)

**Position:** 50 Shares at 10.50.

SHOP,BABA Analysis,1604502667.0,"**ANYONE THINKING ABOUT BUYING BABA SHOULD READ THIS**

I had some free time and went back to go look at the original footage of Jack Ma's speech two weeks ago, and for all that matters I'm Chinese.

Let's just say it wasn't great, he openly made the branches of government regulators: the Chinese SEC, and BRC look like fucking idiots, and tried to quote Xi while doing it. It became viral a few days ago when the news of the suspension hit. People in general are pretty pissed online, and I think that that mood is intentional since it matches the government's stance on the issue.

Jack Ma, founder of BABA and ""de facto head"" of ANT did things like:

""labeling the global banking Basel Accords as an “old people’s club,” Ma said “systemic risk” is not the issue in China. Rather, China’s biggest risk is that it “lacks a financial ecosystem.” Chinese banks are like “pawn shops”, where collateral and guarantees are the hard currencies. As a result, some decided to go so big they are not allowed to fail.""

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d_story.html)

I mean yes it's true these are actual issues, but calling them out for the entirety of the public and media to see is not how shit works in China. There have always been monopoly concerns for BABA both in their eCommerce branch as well as payment branch, which split into ANT.

A lot of people don't know wtf ANT does to earn a 300B+ valuation. Essentially besides being the main competitor to Wechat Pay (basically PYPL or SQ but more widespread, every single vendor in China and aims to serve Chinese customers will accept this), and also having the world's largest money management fund at one point from all the cash from their users that they put on the platform, they've loaned 2T+ RMB to individuals and small businesses (8/2 split). Which is about 300B. This is through two services called Jiebei and Huabei, essentially it's just like you doing cash withdrawal from your credit card but obviously, all of it is electronic at 18% interest per annum (which is high in China). Here's the thing, ANT started this whole thing with 3.8B RMB. They leveraged up 100x+ by selling tranched securities on their loans which they packaged. So ANT makes a shit ton of money, ""risk-free"" leveraged to the tits.

ANT ABS 1B RMB
https://imgur.com/a/PUJvl0Q

For every billion they loan out, 0.95B is recovered through selling the A and B Tranch at 6.1% and 7.5% interest respectively. Ant makes the difference between that and 18%. And can repeat that so on as they still have money. Which means 1/0.05 = 20x from banks and the market. This became closer to 100x+ after they used subsidiaries and other financial maneuvers to buy their own C tranch.


This is why the Chinese government is seriously pissed, there is a huge fucking default bomb that could lead to sector collapse since ANT sold off these securities to asset management and banks, and then used the money they gained from the securities to make more loans and make more securities. Thereby repeating the cycle precisely because the fintech company wasn't regulated at the same standard as Chinese banks. Now Jack Ma has the balls to come in and criticize the very thing that made his business possible in the first place?

A day after Jack Ma had the meeting with the big 4 regulatory agencies (Central Bank, SEC, Bank and Insurance Commission, and Foreign Exchange Commission), they released a draft of new legislation called  网络小额贷款业务管理暂行办法

There's no Official English but it means

**Laws Regarding The Current Management of Small Online Loans** (Draft)

Among the new laws, the chief one is that companies cannot leverage over 1x via bank loans, and leverage up to 4x through securitization, as well as the fact that the loan originator needs to provide over 30% of the amount.

So the reason BABA is dipping so hard is that this immediately fucks up the valuation of ANT, they need a serious injection of cash to stay afloat with their current loans. Which was precisely the point of the IPO. If ANT is valued as a bank rather than a fintech company (and that's what regulations suggest), then they're fucked. Now I don't think this means BABA is going to nosedive, but there are going to be better opportunities considering the headline risk.

**TLDR: My warning for anyone looking to buy the dip is that it's not as easy money as you think**

Positions:

AVOID BABA for at least the next month

Edit: Since price action has been nothing but positive for the market in general, very short calls will probably print. There may be more bad news in the horizon. It is my belief that JD is a better position that is similar in nature.

SHOP,Why I'm not worried about a resurgence of inflation,1603654217.0,"**TL/DR**: Despite massive fiscal stimulus packages and seemingly never-ending quantitative easing programs, I don't believe we're headed towards a world of out-of-control inflation. Why? The prospect of permanent economic scarring in certain sectors due to extended lockdowns coupled with rapid technological adoption are two factors that are likely to keep price pressures low.

**Investors seem quite concerned about rising inflation risk**, which is likely supporting the strong bid for inflation-hedging assets like gold and bitcoin year to date. Adding fuel to the fire, top money managers, like Bridgewater and BlackRock, have been vocal in financial media lately about the risk of a high-inflation regime down the road. A high-inflation regime would be a remarkable departure from the past decade, where inflation was relatively tame even despite ultra-low interest rates and the introduction of unconventional monetary policy tools, like quantitative easing (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC](https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC)).

Similar to what was observed over the past cycle, I don't see recent policy action leading to sky-high inflation in the future. 

* First, it's important to note that **fiscal and monetary stimulus is a** ***response*** **to a weak economic outlook**. Direct income assistance (i.e. the CARES Act) is meant to help offset lost wages due to extended lockdowns and business closures. Those who believe inflation is going to materially rise would argue that the government built a ""bridge too far"" - though so far the pandemic has outlasted the duration of U.S. stimulus measures.
* Second, **the pandemic has supercharged the digital economy**. E-commerce is exploding (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/7GQknX6](https://ibb.co/7GQknX6)) - a long-term trend that I believe is likely here to stay.  It is well studied that e-commerce is a deflationary force (read more here: [https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649)). The intuition is straightforward - the internet increases price transparency, lowers barriers to entry, fuels competition, and increases aggregate supply. More online shopping is likely to keep goods price inflation in check for now. This goes without mentioning innovations in the services sector, such as telehealth and online education, which could also keep inflation at bay.

Lastly, as a professional investor focused on global macro, predicting where the global economy is headed is *hard* and an incredibly humbling exercise. I prefer preparing my own portfolio for a range of outcomes - so while I personally hold *some* gold and bitcoin, I wouldn't bet the farm on a resurgence of inflation in the future."

SHOP,"I’m back dipshits. DD Summary for 11/15-11/18 Cinemark, eBay, HD Supply, and The Return of Your DD Daddy, TLDR and plays included",1605743336.0,"**Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary!** For those of you that don’t remember me, I am the sick fuck that used to comb through all the DD you idiots post and combine all the relevant information into one post a few times a week. That’s how I got the flair. I took a break but now I’m back and have fewer brain cells than ever! As in previous posts, the ticker will be in bold on the left and I write this so that the info I deem most “important” will be near the top. I would ask you to read all the way through to get the most information you can, but honestly I don’t give a shit. As always a follow-up from previous DD summaries (not this time), TLDR, and plays will be at the bottom. I know you cucks are greedy so this info can give you a little more variety instead of only playing with Elons testes all day.

&#x200B;

**CNK**\- Cinemark is a movie theatre company and before you roll your eyes and scroll on, take a look because it has a lot more potential than you think. Cinemark owns theatres in 42 states and 16 countries totaling over 6,000 screens. Granted they are not being used right now but that is a lot of assets. For being shutdown, they are doing surprisingly well. They have more than enough cash on hand to last many more months and that is if they make no profits at all which is highly unlikely. Even if this were to last longer than their cash, they have very manageable debt and more than enough assets to cover it. The majority of their debt is long-term and most of it isn't even due until 2023 which gives them more than enough time to either roll it over or generate enough capital to pay it down. The positive information above isn’t even taking into account the [deal they just made](https://ir.cinemark.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/478/universal-filmed-entertainment-group-and-cinemark-theaters) with Universal (which includes DreamWorks) to release in their theatres for at least 3 weeks before they can release the movies anywhere else. This is fantastic news because it gives them exclusive access to the opening few weeks of any movie which historically is when they make their most money. 

What can you take away from this? This is a company that is being managed very well given the circumstances. Long term movie theatres are not going away. They may change but for many people, nothing beats going and seeing something on the big screen. Given the fact that AMC is gasping for air, CNK has the potential to become the leading movie theatre in the nation. To me, shares are the best idea. Long term and at this discount they will net you some good profits. But I know that's not how you fucks work, you want options. The [original poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvxjpu/cinemarks_cnk_free_tendies/) advocated for 20c for 4/21 and 30c for 12/21 which is very reasonable. THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. For more info take a look at their [10-k](https://ir.cinemark.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-005646/0001564590-20-005646.pdf) and previous [earnings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_529fa8877bd02a78fc90e3d84715e621/cinemark/news/2020-11-05_Cinemark_Holdings_Inc_Reports_Results_for_the_475.pdf). 

&#x200B;

**EBAY-** We all know eBay. A substantial online consumer sales company that has been around for years. What some of you don't know is that they are at 3-month lows GOING INTO BLACK FRIDAY. Are you fucking kidding me? An online store that makes money every Black Friday is down on a year where online shopping is at numbers never seen before in history? Seems like people are confused. Last year they made 2.8 billion in their [4th quarter](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q4-2019_FINAL.pdf) which includes Black Friday and Christmas. Just last earnings (3rd Quarter 2020) they [reported earnings](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q3-2020_FINAL.pdf) of **2.6 billion**. A quarter without Black Friday and Christmas made almost as much as they did last year doing those times. Using just 9 out of the total of 15 brain cells I have and a little bit of extrapolation, I can say that they are going to crush last year's Q4 numbers. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwls84/ebay_call_the_safest_option_you_can_get/) has some more information you can take a look there and at the other links to further decide for yourself. OP says 55 or 60c for January 21 which seems like a safe bet, but if you want a shorter-term play, I would say around 49.5-51 for mid to late December would work just as well. This will be closing the holiday shopping season and locking in profits for eBay.

&#x200B;

**HDS-** I'll just pull stuff straight from the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwk6iq/the_knock_off_home_depot/), 

>HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America. Their revenue is 7.39 billion. Home Depot has decided to acquire it...

After news of the acquisition hit the price jumped to 55 from 44. Home Depot plans to acquire them for 56 a share cash. This news, however, disregards the fact that FOUR INDEPENDENT LAW FIRMS for possibly breaching their fiduciary duties or violating the federal securities laws in connection with the company’s acquisition by The Home Depot, Inc. Uh oh, that's not good. If these firms find anything, and they very well could, expect acquisition talks to breakdown completely and the stock price to tank. And guess what, they dropped a bit after market close as well. Watch the news closely because this is quite possibly a slamdunk for puts given how quickly the price rises and falls. The price may hover around 55 for a while given Home Depot but just watch. This could be a nightmare for both companies. Given all that, make sure you do a little of your own research. 

&#x200B;

**Knowledge-** Now back in May, I made [this post explaining how to play earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge06g7/how_to_play_earnings_like_youre_not_a_retard_tldr/) like you were not completely incompetent. There is a lot more that goes into it than just earnings. You also have to understand the psychology of the market which is really fucking difficult. We have all lost a shit ton of money because a company did good on earnings and the market decided it wasn’t good enough. Or they took a shit on earnings but not a huge shit and the market sent it to the moon. I have a bit of experience in this sector knowing quite a bit about mass psychology so if you would like a post similar to the earnings one about market psychology then let me know.

&#x200B;

That’s all I’ve got for today. Good luck fuckers and, for those of you that remember, instead of doing these summaries 3 times a week I will be doing them after market close on Wednesday and Sunday nights so that you can work through all the big words in your head before market open the next day.

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Cinemark has a pretty good chance of pulling out of this a bigger player in the movie industry. eBay is undervalued given their extremely high likelihood of killing earnings and raking in cash because of the holiday season. HD Supply is being investigated and acquisition talks could take a turn for the worst. I know about market psychology, would you like to?

**Plays;** CNK 20c 4/21 or 30c 12/21, EBAY 55-60c 1/21 or 49-51c 12/20, HDS 55p 12/20 1/21 or 3/21 with 3/21 being the safest bet.

SHOP,$TGT - The Karen Play,1606238162.0,"I’ve posted about TGT before, since those posts (check my history if you want), we’ve seen sizable gains through and after earnings.  

Here’s what I know about Q4 - 

Target will continue to increase market cap, still under $90B, it remains one of the cheapest retailers in the S&P500.  

With partnerships across multiple entities, and a supply chain that’s best in class, I don’t see many reasons to dislike this stock.  To name a few - CVS, Ulta, Shipt, Overstock, Bed Bath and Beyond.  

Target is taking market share from all of their partners, it’s a natural cannibalizarion, and it will likely continue for some time.  

Target is taking market share from its competitors, mainly WMT and AMZN, as they succeed in the tech space, and the retail space.  

The main competitor which will hurt Target is Costco, which to me, feels like more of a threat to WMT, than TGT.  Why?  Karen.  

Karen loves Target.  There’s high enough margins on goods, that it keeps most of the poor people at WMT.  

Karen also likes Wholefoods, but she only shops there for special things.  She knows she can get a 10% discount for most of the name brands at Wholefoods vs Target.  

Karen has a RedCard.  The 5% she saves on all transactions, plus free shipping makes it a staple in her wallet.  

Karen uses the Target app or Shipt.  Maybe not as much as AMZN, but it’s on her Home Screen.  

Karen likes Target pickup.  During a pandemic, nothing is easier that getting your apples brought to your car.  

Karen has unlimited buying power, and is a customer who doesn’t often change shopping habits.  

Karen is going to buy a bunch of Christmas candles and nonsense decor, where do you think she’s going to purchase it?  

Karen likes that there’s a Starbucks in the store, it’s the main reason she came, but she’ll buy groceries for her kids while she’s here.  


Retards of WSB, my Karen thesis.  


Thus far, I’ve made $48k on target this year.  

My plays: 

$TGT $180 Mar ‘21
$TGT $180 Dec ‘20
$TGT $185 Dec ‘20
$TGT $185 Jan 21
$TGT $200 Mar ‘21
$TGT $200 Jan ‘21

I also own 500 shares at a cost basis of $140s.  


This is boomer DD, for easy money.  If you want crazy DD, buy $NIO.  


Good luck!"

BJ has the combined retard strength of being both a covid and holiday stock. Its growth potential is evident by all technical and analytical metrics. It's been crushing ER's all year, and I expect this trend to continue with full fucking steam ahead.

- On a steady rise from $19 since Feb.

- Has been maintaining the following EPS Surprise:

2019 Q4: +0.48%

2020 Q1: +85.75%

Q2: +27.91%

Q3: +43.16%

- Online Presence:

They didn't have a strong e-commerce presence a few years ago but are adapting quite well today. Offering Black Friday deals, Curbside, 2-hour Grocery Delivery, and Free Shipping.

- Covid:

I can say from personal experience (I've been shopping at my local store for many years now) that they handled it well. They were able to stay profitable because they didn't panic back in March/April and instead deployed the right policies to get people in and literally buy tendies and toiler paper. They were able to stay decently stocked thru most of the early pandemic panic and stayed profitable. I have no doubt that they will do an even better job this time around once shit really starts hitting the fan for round 2.


This is not a high volume stock which will turn many people off and understandably so. But it is a low IV growth stock with some solid entries at the moment. 

My positions:

12/18 50C (Super cheap right now. Looking for a holiday/covid run-up in December)

3/19/21 50C (Longer term play that includes their Q4 ER scheduled for early March)

SHOP,Playing Dollar General Earnings (12/3),1605825817.0,"Hey guys I just wanna note, this is not a pimp and dump. 

Dollar General, in terms of stock or options, seems fairly undervalued considering their earnings is coming up. Friday would probably be the best time to get in some long $220/$230 calls. 

#IV is very low

1) Average Same store sales have not been negative since 1983, in a pandemic too! All positive sales growth.

**2) Recently opened 17,000th store, now imagine if avg same store sales growth has been positive every year, then if they have more stores, then overall growth is going to be bigger. Especially in a pandemic where people want cheaper supply.**

3) Open stores in the perfect markets(ie. small towns and food deserts) Where WMT is 30 minutes away, why not shop at Dollar General 10 minutes away, and it’s cheaper!!

#They prey on poor white Americans 

^^^ If you’re from /r/politics this might be the play for u, i know y’all AOC supporters really HATE poor, traditional marriage preserving, whites from ALABAMER (pls mods this is joke, i am not politic man)

**4) DG is not a dollar store, which is why they’ve outperformed DLTR. They are closer to a BIG, which surprise surprise, has also outperformed discount retail with DG**

**5) To my point 4, they’re a discount store, not a dollar store. People are being cost-effective in this pandemic so shop at a cheaper grocery place**

6) I lived in AmityVille and had a new Dollar General open in Amityville. Lemme tell you, i’ve see mad people go there and DGs target market is areas where min wage is 8-10$ not $15! (i’ve never entered though because i’m scared of people darker than my mother (she is from india)). love ya mom!!! 🥰😘😘 

So yea, something has to be going good for DG, i got that macro DD and that local, micro-DD, about a newly opened store in my areas

Again, **points two and four** are highlighted for a reason. I’m not manipulating data, technical wise LOOK AT THE stock chart. it’s held $208 pretty well and i’ve actually flipped a pretty penny the past days just buying at open when that happen.

again, read points 2,4,5 those are the biggest reasons this stock is up 24% since march or some shit

if u mexican u know they also got a sale on pumpkins and milk, and i know y’all mexicanos fuck with pumpkins and milk"

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
> Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
> In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
> “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
> “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
> Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
> The S&P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
> JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
> “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
> But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
> The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
> The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
> Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
> Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
> “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
> She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

> # The Thanksgiving Trade

> Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&P 500 decline was in 1964.

> Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**

> Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

> # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

> First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> After Monday’s record close, the S&P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

> The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

> Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # Finally A New High for Small Caps

> It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

> The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

> # A Month for the Ages

> Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

> In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

> In the large-cap S&P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

> While just about every stock in the S&P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

> # Long Term Averages Taken Out

> With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

> As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

> In the table below, we show a list of the S&P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

> # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

> Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

> Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

SHOP,"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",1605246827.0,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Estée Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company’s CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company’s gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it’s never your fault. It’s the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic."

SHOP,Here's BABA 🍼 for all you babies 👶🏼,1605286902.0,"In technical terms, the observed correction of Alibaba's price is, in principle, natural.

The current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

In terms of comparable valuation, Alibaba is undervalued against the market.

DCF-based BABA stock price target suggests 100% upside potential.

#1 Price vs. Growth
Let's start with some purely technical parameters.

Starting from mid-2015, Alibaba's (BABA) stock price has been following, with varied success, its long-term exponential trend that acts as a smart average. Now, the company's current share price is synchronized with this trend, but until recently it has significantly outperformed it.

At the same time, looking at the rolling annual total price return, we can say that in the last few months, the rise in the price of Alibaba's stock has been excessive. And therefore, the observed correction is, in principle, natural.

Moving onto more fundamental parameters.

Over the past two quarters of the fiscal year 2021, the average expectations of analysts regarding the growth of BABA's revenue and EPS in the current and next fiscal year tend to increase. 

And here, it is pertinent to recall that more than 90% of the revenue Alibaba receives is in the domestic market.

In turn, China is the only large country in the world whose economy is growing during the coronavirus epidemic. Source: OECD

And there is virtually no coronavirus problem in China. 

In short, the company's external business environment looks optimistic.

Moving onto Alibaba's valuation. 

The long-term relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size is linear. Formally, this reflects investor confidence in the stability of the company's future growth rates.

By the way, this relationship identifies Alibaba's current capitalization as balanced. But, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q1 '22 FY, BABA's revenue TTM will be around $13 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational capitalization will come close to $900 billion.

The second one is the relationship between Alibaba's capitalization and the FCF TTM absolute size. In this case, the company's current price is balanced too:

In the context of the above, I believe that the current growth dynamics of the company justify its current price.

#2 Comparable Valuation
I single out two multiples, which makes it possible to compare Alibaba with the market. Both multiples are forward and both are adjusted for the growth rate of the basic indicators (I used a four-year CAGR).

Judging by the Forward P/S (next FY) multiple, Alibaba is undervalued now.

A comparative valuation of BABA through the Forward P/E (next FY) multiple also indicates that the company is undervalued.

In terms of comparable valuation, I believe Alibaba is undervalued against the market right now.

#3 DCF Valuation
To forecast the company's revenue for the next decade, I used a polynomial model that most closely matches the current average estimates of analysts. I believe that such approach is the least subjective.

To calculate the weighted average cost of capital, I used the current yield of China 10-Year Bond as a risk-free rate for the Chinese market (3.28%), equity risk premium (6.26%), and 3-year rolling beta coefficient (0.71). To calculate the cost of debt, I used the interest expense for 2019 and 2020 FY divided by the debt value for the same years.

When building the model, I used the following key assumptions:

In the next decade, Alibaba's operating margin will decline from the current 18% to 15% in a terminal year.

The relative size of CAPEX will be on average over the past six years.

The average tax rate will amount to 25%.

The DCF-based target price of Alibaba's shares is $541, offering 101% upside.

Bottom Line

In fact, China's economy is now the only one capable of showing growth. At the same time, the online shopping industry in China is booming due to fear of the pandemic. These are two powerful and undisputed growth drivers for Alibaba.

Chinese stock exchanges reacted mostly positively to the likely election of Biden as president of the United States. Although it is too early to draw conclusions, judging by the general tone in the media, it is expected that bilateral policy will become more predictable. At the very least, this reduces the risks for BABA.

Fundamentally, BABA is undervalued. It is obvious. And time will fix it.

TLDR: $BABA $295 4/21"

SHOP,Vaccine news priced in. Consolidation taking place. Bearish outlook both short and long term.,1605284897.0,"**Positions: SPY 350p 12/20 , VXX 22c 12/20**

I've been holding cash since my last winning play on November 2nd. Decided to enter a new position today, probably sometime this afternoon as VIX gradually settles down. Here are my thoughts for the near-term and some advice on how to play this wild market.

We all knew there would be another vaccine news bump in the markets. That bump hit, but it fizzled quickly. We aren't out of the woods on Covid yet, not by a long shot. The vaccine still won't be available for many months, and cases are still quickly rising. Nothing we didn't already know on that front...

The important point here is that vaccine news has had time to soak in and is now priced into the markets. The vaccine bump was a short-term peak that closed out the upward channel SPY has been following the past several days. Things are flattening out and we are now in a consolidation pattern, with buyers and sellers battling within a range of price consolidation. Looks like support roughly around 351 and resistance around 357 for SPY.

https://preview.redd.it/n4e16sci21z51.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=211daf4b46682bf64a94406bd4c31eb599d9b9dd

The way Covid will impact retail sales around the Black Friday / Christmas period is definitely an interesting question. I highly doubt we will see the old widely publicized black friday hysteria. We may even see news reports showing emptied out shopping malls and such for contrast to previous years, which will hurt consumer and business sentiment. But that is simply speculation on my part. The more important factors are the long-term indicators.

The Powell-induced euphoria pumped the markets up over the past several months to strongly over-priced levels, using any metric you wish. I'm still a fan of the Detrended Buffett Indicator, and even with the projected rise in GDP the market is still strongly overvalued. Every buyer is fighting against this inherent downward pressure, and it can not last forever.

https://preview.redd.it/aby9l49f41z51.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f5af19ca3b141283dc85321a6176f915519744c

At some point this market is going to unwind, and hard. The only impossible thing to know is when. So here is my basic strategy in this market, in a nutshell:

**My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**

I'm getting those bearish tingles again, so will be entering a conservative options position starting today.

The VXX was down roughly 5% today and is near it's post-Covid low point, which again makes it a good opportunity to buy, so I will be adding VXX calls to my SPY puts. I'll be making a fairly short-term position with just enough wiggle room to hold if things start to unwind again in the coming weeks.

SHOP,Polaris will crush earnings (again),1603722688.0,"Recap:

Gloomy Q1:

Q1 sales decreased 6% with net loss of $0.09 per share.

Off-road vehicle (ORV) sales and snowmobiles account for 69% of PII’s gross profit.

ORV sales declined 7%. Snowmobiles declined 54%. Despite last quarter’s decline, motorcycle sales increased 7%.

CEO Scott Wine stated: ""We expect the COVID-19 pandemic, and its corresponding shock to the economy, to be a substantial challenge for the global economy and our business through the remainder of the year and possibly longer,” offering a cautious/gloomy forecast due to the general uncertainty.

Catalysts for a Q2 Rebound:

1.       The bar for Q2 was logically set very low due to the unpredictability of how the economy and the public would react to Covid-19.

2.       New multi-million defense contract to produce military dune bugs. This will bolster future guidance.

3.       ORV sales, which make up the bulk of PII’s profit, will skyrocket. Anecdotally, I’ve been seeing the RZR ORVs everywhere. Summer is mudding season. A RZR just won a big race on Tuesday. They seem to be getting a lot of attention. Motorcycle sales should also see an uptick here, seeing that it was able to increase 7% in Q1 in spite of early Covid-19.

4.       Rise in e-commerce sales in wake of restructuring after Q1 and increasing online accessibility.

5.       Polaris is an American company. Being American-made has become more attractive in light of the China trade tension and due to more people wanting to support local during the Covid-19 crisis. Market sentiment has been Bullish. Look at recent articles.

TLDR: Stuck at home on quarantine with stimulus check money = Buy off-road toys to get outside and ride. Support ‘Merican companies. 100C 8/21 

-----------------------------------------------------------

The above was my DD for the previous quarter, and it printed nicely.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I'm expecting another earnings beat based on a continuation of what I've already said, along with these new catalysts:

6.        Polaris recently announced a 10 year partnership with Zero to create EV ORVs. I'm expecting more information about this partnership. So far we can expect EV ORVs and snowmobiles, but we haven't heard much about their Indian motorcycles. Zero has been described as the Tesla of motorcycles.

7.        Valuation. PII was recently upgraded. We've only seen positive news for PII since the last quarter and we're again trading below 100/share, I think reclaiming 100 and breaking out to new highs is on the table if we get another strong quarter. The expansion into the EV realm could be the breakthrough PII needs.

8.         Demand for boats will surge. PII acquired Boat Holdings and Larson Boats within the last couple years. High demand during covid season, for the same reason ORVs surged, should materialize in Q3 earnings.

TLDR: PII benefits from the Rona. ORVs surged last quarter. This trend will continue, this time with a surge in boating demand as well. Expect bullish updates on EV expansion. PII 100C 11/20

Here is a list of the stocks I've sold that have gone up anywhere from 2x-10x. yes, every single one of these I got in quite low:

AMD, NVDA, BABA,TSLA (this one is killing me),SHOP (this one also is killing me, got in <$100), PTON, TWTR, FB,CRSP, AUPH

I had my fair share of losers along the way, not like I was batting 1000. and not like I would've been a millionaire if I kept these, but my financial situation would be DRASTICALLY different than it is now. It really would've been a life-changing amount of money, for me, for my current situation.

SHOP,Reminiscences of a Stock Operator: The Evolution of the Average WSB Autist,1605912967.0,"**TLDR:** Alan Greenspan called this book ""a font of investing wisdom"" famous quotes such as ""bulls and bears make money; pigs get slaughtered"" originated from this book.

This book is a true story of how one boy leveraged 100-to-1 and successfully became a millionaire many times over. He buys a yacht, takes lavish vacations, and eventually has enough money to influence market movements.

*• 1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the bid–ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at bucket shops.*

This is where your average WSB autist starts. Robinhood is essentially the modern day “bucket shop” where people buy and sell stock based on tips they hear as well as crude technical analysis tools. Instead of 100-to-1 leverage, we use options.

*• 1910-1920: Livermore was a stock trader on the New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.*

Even the great traders of our time lost it all more than once. The most useful lesson is to trim down your leverage and do not “revenge trade”. You need to stay in the right state of mind at all times. The moment you start thinking “I just lost a house payment” it is too late. The money in your account needs to feel like points in a game. It is much better to play the odds and lose on the right play than win money on pure luck.

*• 1920s: Livermore engaged in market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.*

This is where the big dogs are now. Read this section and learn how the market manipulation works. It was the same back then as it is today. Large players will test the market, find resistance, and manipulate the price to sell into retail strength. A lot of posts on this sub are part of pumping and dumping stocks. Remember that you are following the Big Dogs to tendies, and you need to get out before your favorite meme stock leaves you bag-holding.

 **Shopify rallies after crushing revenue, profit estimates**

Shopify Inc. defied market expectations once again in the third quarter, posting stronger-than-expected results as the global pandemic continued to push shoppers out of bricks-and-mortar stores and onto online platforms.

Revenue at Canada’s largest company by stock market value nearly doubled to US$767.4 million while adjusted earnings were US$1.13 per share, more than twice analysts’ estimates of 52 cents.

“The accelerated shift to digital commerce triggered by COVID-19 is continuing, as more consumers shop online and entrepreneurs step up to meet demand,” Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said in the earnings statement.

 

**Key Insights**

\-Gross merchandise volume -- a measure of product sales flowing through its platform -- was US$30.9 billion, an increase of 109 per cent over the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong e-commerce spending by consumers.

\-The company continued to gain traction in new services it offers to customers. Shopify said 51 per cent of eligible merchants in the U.S. and Canada used Shopify Shipping in the third quarter of 2020, versus 45 per cent in the third quarter of 2019.

\-Its lending business is growing as well. Merchants in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. received $252.1 million in merchant cash advances and loans from Shopify Capital in the quarter, an increase of 79 per cent  from the amount received by U.S. merchants in the same quarter last ye

\-The company expects its model to remain popular with buyers and sellers in the pandemic but cited macro risks in its decision not to provide fourth quarter or full-year guidance.

“These include unemployment, fiscal stimulus, and the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which may impact new shop creation on our platform and consumer spending”: Shopify

Shopify shares were up 2.9 per cent in pre-market trading at 7:52 a.m. in New York. The stock is up more than 680% in the past two years and had nearly tripled since the March low, as of Wednesday’s close, as the pandemic accelerated the push by retailers and small businesses to move sales online.

Founded in 2004, the Ottawa-based firm’s core business is helping retailers get online quickly and cheaply. But it has expanded to offer an ever-widening suite of services, including lending, payments and shipping solutions. With a market capitalization of almost $125 billion, the company is now Canada’s largest publicly traded company."
SHOP,No Stimulus before the Holiday Season (Poll),1603943294.0,"Looks like the stimulus will have to come AFTER the election due to the failure of American politicians. 

How will this impact holiday shopping? 

1. People still go out and buy as much as they can because YOLO and brrrrrr. (Calls)

2. People don’t got out and buy as much, but the expected sales number gets lowered dramatically so we can beat it with any number and it looks good. (Calls) 

3. Hoards of people pile into massive lines, everyone gets covid, but you still get that new 70 inch 4k. (Calls)

4. All stores do not host a typical black friday sale. Sales are shit. The ones that do become cesspools of covid infections. The number continues to increase dramatically. More riots. No stimulus. Election fatigue because they still can’t prove who won. Black Friday becomes RED 🩸 🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸Friday. (PUTS)"

SHOP,🐻🌈 Application.,1604945035.0,"POS: SPY 340p 01/15

Covid is getting extremely bad in my area. Almost all of my friends went to Halloween parties and have been going out since. One by one they are testing positive, and the ones that are supposed to be isolating don't even care and are still going out shopping and to the gym, etc. I work part-time at a gas station and I still see people without masks on the daily, our gasoline demand has been back on the downtrend since mid-October as well.

This vaccine news is great but looks more like a market pump and dump to me. It doesn't really matter how amazing this vaccine is if they are only producing 50 million doses in 2020. Covid is a now issue, with cases rising exponentially, 50 million is nowhere near enough for the US let alone the world. I hope I'm wrong, I'd happily lose this money if it meant my friends and family were safe, but I just don't see that happening anytime soon. What would be even worse is if this causes the government to not be urgent on another stimulus, many people need stimulus now, but this vaccine pump might cause a stimulus delay till Biden takes office.

""Also, whenever a vaccine does arrive, initial supplies will be scarce and rationed, with priority likely to be given to health care workers and others on the front lines.

SHOP,The death of the classic 60/40 portfolio,1604170417.0,"Bonds provide safe returns over a long period of time. If we replace the bonds in our portfolio with stocks/inflation linked bonds, returns will increase.

Bonds are used to hedge against a decline in stock prices. When interest rates across the globe are, at or close to zero (even negative in some cases) then nominal bond yields decrease substantially and can even have negative returns if inflation increases.

The US Fed has recently committed to keeping interest rates at or close to zero until 2023, have stated that they will continue to buy treasuries, at a rate $120B per month and will allow inflation to rise above above 2%. Due to these statements, it becomes clear that bonds will likely have low to negative returns for the foreseeable future.

With debt being so cheap and a deficit of 100% of US GDP (a potential 1-3 trillions dollar more to be printed), it becomes undeniable that higher inflation is here to stay. The result of this can be seen when looking at the current gold prices being at all time highs (gold is an inflation hedge), home sales in US and Canada being at all time highs (incredibly low mortgage rates makes it the best time to buy) and the DXY (the dollar against a basket of other currencies) being at a 2 year low, one can only conclude that, it is time to get out of bonds.

SHOP,KODK Earnings Date Silence is Golden,1603900280.0,"We're coming up on Q3 2020 earnings for KODK, which have historically been released around the second week of November.  This time around, that's potentially around the 11th of November, they seem to like midweek.

I've said this in a previous post, but my thesis is that KODK is overvalued by about 3-4x right now based on it's mid-July price and revenue. More details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfexpy/emperor\_kodk\_has\_no\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfexpy/emperor_kodk_has_no_clothes/)

The likely end of the Trump administration coupled with there is no way KODK has brought in revenue this quarter to justify this price means the stock is likely to drop after earnings.  They also have announced nothing concrete about pursuing this pharma, despite a WSJ article stating they could 'do it on their own'. Since my last post, KODK has fallen 16% in price, and my contracts have gained 40% value.

My belief is that KODK will fall to at least $3.5/share as soon as investors realize they have no clothes, and likely return to July levels with a realization they will not be receiving this loan that is almost their entire market capitalization in July.

Counter: It's possible KODK will announce these plans on their earnings call, meaning the speculation for producing pharma ingredients may continue.  However, without a loan from the DFC, they would have to shop around, and those Kathy's are chatty as fuck.  Secondly, this is a market pretty well dominated by other players, including US companies. Without a loan, this is a capital intensive process unlikely to bear fruit for 5+ years.

SNE,Want a PS5? Buy SNE,1604596595.0,"Is your mother's boyfriend refusing to buy you a PS5 for Christmas? Stop being a leech and get one on your own with this amazing play.

- SNE Average Price Target: $98 (High: $126, Low: $80. Keep in mind that these estimates are usually set by conservative boomer-in-suits who have a hard time powering up their Compaq Presario's in time let alone keeping up with trends)

It's currently underperforming. The market hasn't caught up yet. This thing will be trading for $100+ by Jan and $120+ by the time they report on Q4.

- TikTok just made a massive deal with Sony Music this week which is Sony's other big earner during Covid.

Add their recent acquisition of Crunchyroll and it's a no-brainer. They're undervalued as one of the big home media companies. (Thanks, u/jakeupnorth)

- It knocked its last two earnings out of the park.

8/4 report and 10/28 reports both got crushed but this is just the beginning. 

- Catalyst 1:


PS5 is set to release next week and that hype alone will drive this thing to $93+


- Catalyst 2:


Holiday season that will give an uptick on all Sony consumer products including the PS5

- Catalyst 3:


Stimulus. The country needs another one. No one knows if Donnie boy will be too busy pouting over a loss to deliver one, but if it does come thru - buckle the fuck up. 


Here are the plays:

1. 12/18 100C - We're only 12% off from getting there and the contracts are CHEAP. This captures both the PS5 release and some of the holiday hype.

2. 1/15 100C - Capture the entire holiday hype with more potential for a stimulus run-up.

3. 3/19 100C - The Bagholder Play. This includes their Q4 earnings which will be absolutely massive. 


4. Stonks - They are particularly gay around these parts but they make a lot of sense for this play. If you're gay and are into stonks I will not judge you (outside of me doing it just now) and I would advise you to load up if you want maximum safety with upside.


TL;DR:
I'm personally in on 12/18 100C's.


**Edit** (12:45 AM 11/6)

My original play of 12/18 100C premium has increased substantially since first posting this. I believe that it is *not* too late to get in at the .90 price, but it is up to you to access the play and determine an entry. Let Friday play out and enter mid-day maybe. Maybe we lose all earnings mid-day and it'll be a great time to enter--who knows. Point is, you need to find a good entry and not enter this willy-nilly. In any case, this isn't a play that you want to miss out on."

Going into next gen, digital games will overtake physical games which would mean more profits for Sony. Lockdowns have also benefited video games in general.

The PS5 launch seems to be a pretty big hit from everything I've seen. The new diskless PS5 while not as desirable will lock people into buying games directly from Sony. So they should have a margin boost there.   
 

Sony's music platform recently reached a deal with TikTok so Sony is making moves to try and stay relevant with the younger demographic. 

&#x200B;

Sony is rumored to be buying Crunchyroll which is one of the leading anime streaming services. Sony already owns Funimation so it will have a big chunk of anime titles under its belt. Not sure if they plan to combine the two or keep them separate. They already license a lot of Funimation content to Hulu but I wouldn't be surprised if they started to pull content and force users to their services. If they did I would expect a lot of people to switch. Hulu has no original anime that I'm aware of and Netflix original animes have been mostly dumpster fire. Some good ones here and there but most of it is forgettable. Amazon tried to make their own anime streaming service called Anime Strike but shut it down after a year.

SNE,"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",1605246827.0,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Estée Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company’s CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company’s gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it’s never your fault. It’s the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic."

IBM,IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis,1605838326.0,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going. "
IBM,"What are examples of ""cannot-fail"" stocks that ended up crashing and staying down?",1604134432.0,"There are some companies today that, at a glance, might just seem too big to fail (say, google, microsoft, apple, amazon, alibaba, etc). 

This made me wonder, have there been examples in the past of similarly large companies that everyone/most assumed couldn't fail, but ended up crashing down and staying there? I'm not necessarily asking about companies that had comparable assets, but rather about companies that were similarly perceived by many as ""too big to fail""."

IBM,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,1605979063.0,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

IBM,LONG $HON QUANTUM SUPREMACY,1605489960.0,"**Honeywell and the Quantum Computing Revolution**

Honeywell is a huge industrial conglomerate that has been a legacy manufacturing company for several decades now. Many of you know what the company is, but you probably also know them vaguely compared to some of their other industrial competitors such as General Electric. Honeywell is a huge defense contractor and a manufacturer of productivity and building solutions such as thermostats, security systems, and air purifiers. Honeywell’s aerospace division manufactures engines and provides integrated avionics solutions along with them. Honeywell also manufactures automobile parts such as turbochargers and electricity solutions. On top of that, they provide the software necessary for a lot of their own tools and technologies to function. You could say that Honeywell is a large legacy company that has a solid line of products, it functions in an industry where there’s not much new competition grabbing at your throat, and that in and of itself makes it a buy. However, while Honeywell may have fit into the average portfolio that needs manufacturing just fine, it’s not exactly an amazing value. It has several large competitors domestically and internationally and they don’t do seemingly anything outside of the ordinary that GE (which is a better value) does, or that Siemens (an international competitor) does. As far as the average investor can tell, there’s no growth prospect for him and as far as the experienced one can tell, there’s no opportunity within the company either. However, as I was going through the news (as an investor should) I discovered that [Honeywell is developing their own quantum computer](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/06/the-worlds-highest-performing-quantum-computer-is-here), which should position it very nicely for an investor looking for safe and sustainable growth as Honeywell has some very solid financials and the potential in the quantum computing segment is huge. Due to COVID-19, their past quarterly results were significantly down as their aerospace revenues depend significantly on global air traffic, but their share prices haven’t suffered much and that I believe has primarily to do with the 2 things I’ll discuss in here; an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a high-growth potential industry. 

Let’s start off looking at Honeywell’s finances:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zuypj8ra7iz51.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10faea11f73330047e1f50ac8b7ffc127d6263a

For the past few years, cash has grown at a far higher rate when in proportion to total debt

Here’s a peak into Honeywell’s Income statement, whose growth has been pretty constant until (seemingly) last year. But the reason revenue and Net Income shrank was due to two spin-offs that provided over $10B for them. When factoring for revenue lost due to the sold assets/liabilities, Honeywell’s revenue actually grew by 4% from 2018-2019

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/26e8ppsm7iz51.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d943e978251e21325c6159b15a73b4dfab42a0

  
Due to the sales of unprofitable assets, Honeywell’s gross profit margins have increased significantly in the past 2 years

This explains the EBITDA growth over the past few years as well

&#x200B;

Here’s how Honeywell’s divisions split up currently, with aerospace making up most of their sales, and that division has increased sales by 9% from 2018-2019 when adjusting for spin-offs .

And here’s their SGA Expenses per $ of gross profit

Their profit consistency compared to General Electric or Boeing, two similar industrials companies is remarkable:

Honeywell clearly knows how to manage their financials despite being a complicated conglomerate, which is why their stock price has recovered so well compared to BA and GE. This shows that regardless of how overvalued it may be, that’ll be justified by the means of their consistently growing profits. Investors seek conservative companies such as Honeywell, especially during times of financial volatility, which is why the stock price has fared so much better during these past couple of months compared to their competitors.

**The Future:**

This year despite all of the troubles with COVID-19, Honeywell was able to deliver on their promise of making the world’s highest-performing quantum computer this year. You’ve probably heard the term, but haven’t really bothered to try and understand it. Here, I’ll draw out a very basic dichotomy between a normal computer and a quantum computer.

Traditional computers perform their problem solving through processing information in “bits” which are binary (0s and 1s). These bits are processed through transistors as electrons, but as transistors get smaller and smaller, they reach a point at which the laws of quantum mechanics prevent any further shrinkage. Quantum computers would process information as qubits, and these blocks of information can contain any proportion of 0s and 1s inside of them (superposition), and this greatly increases their information storage capabilities we’d have for problem solving. Another important property of qubits is their ability to become entangled; to have two particles change in accordance with each other, unlocking powerful parallel processing opportunities.

Quantum computing will be an essential technology for Artificial Intelligence, because AI is very simulation and probability based, the nature of quantum computers processing power would be ideal in order to accelerate the parallel processing needed to train and use ML models. In order to solve for the amount of simulations you need for AI-based solutions, the qubit would be the perfect means to solve them. AI solutions can range from cryptography, financial modeling, weather forecasting, and even particle physics.

“[For example](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2019/11/the-future-of-quantum-computing), pharmaceutical companies could accelerate the discovery of new drugs, materials companies could discover new molecular structures, finance companies could develop new trading strategies, transportation companies could optimize logistics, and companies relying on the output of machine and deep learning could perform analyses that are impossible with classical computing of today”

Honeywell is partnering with Microsoft Azure Quantum to enable their computer and they already have a client using it in JP Morgan. Honeywell Ventures has also invested in two large quantum computing companies, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum. Add to that Honeywell’s quantum supremacy: “With a quantum volume of 64, the Honeywell quantum computer is twice as powerful as the next alternative in the industry”

Due to the particularly industrial nature of quantum computers themselves, Honeywell is actually not a surprising entrant into this space. They already have an extensive software segment, and aren’t a slouch there by any means either. Honeywell’s system has [double](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) the quantum volume of IBM’s quantum computer. Honeywell also “[unveiled](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) a two-tier subscription plan designed to make it easier and less expensive for users to upgrade quantum systems”. If Honeywell can successfully create a subscription model for easier quantum accessibility, it would be the next biggest enterprise solution software, magnitudes greater than something simple like CRM. It’s obviously a very complicated and foggy outlook still as to the mysteries of quantum computing, but we know the potential would be tremendous and it could create another leap in the types of problems we can solve as a civilization. 

Not only is a Honeywell a decent value stock by itself, it also has tons of potential with this new segment which investors are clearly pricing in. There are pretty much no events or anything that can cause some awesome volatility for us to bank off, but I think in the next 2-5 year span we'll see a good amount of growth if this works out, so hold stock, but be on the lookout for any announcements that you could possibly play (again no short term play here, sorry)

Positions: stonk"
IBM,We are the market.,1606247421.0,"These old bulls have slowly started to plow into the forest and don't realize why they keep running. Earnings per share? How are the old-growth stocks doing? Don't get me wrong, for the investors, and that's the keyword of this post, INVESTORS, who gave their cash to companies, decades ago, to see them grow like IBM, telecom stocks (ATT), computer hardware and software companies, tobacco (MO), pharma (CVS, PFE), big oil (XOM), whatever else you can picture with mud still clinging to its old shaking knees is exactly what the old bulls formerly bought into so that they could experience life in SPCE.

Those great companies that still bring in revenue are dependant on Earnings Per Share and other boring but essential metrics to watch those slow-ass crops of old grow what little percentage points they still can. So do we care about Earning per Share? Yeah marginally, of course, we want to make a rate of return that beats inflation. Cash gang is almost Bi-🌈🐻. But what is the original idea behind investing other than the giant Plutocrats that need a place to sit on their Bi-🌈🐻 cash-mountain while they wake up not knowing why they are still alive and the game hasn't restart? Well, it's to give cash to the finite producers of the world to watch them fucking grow.

I swear every other old bull is historically embarrassed they were once us and investing in shit that aimed for the moon while it was still in a garage. Now we have to remember for them because they are old bulls and old bulls sometimes forget to fucking plow. They may be sitting on their cash Bi-🌈🐻 hills now and not looking towards the horizon and starting to face plant into the dirt, but we're still ready to bust one for the future.

So why do we hear about pump and dump when it's really pump and pump? We decide where the market goes. We get to invest in whatever we decide is the future of the Earth-Mars marketplace.   We are the market."

The PS5 launch seems to be a pretty big hit from everything I've seen. The new diskless PS5 while not as desirable will lock people into buying games directly from Sony. So they should have a margin boost there.   
 

Sony's music platform recently reached a deal with TikTok so Sony is making moves to try and stay relevant with the younger demographic. 

&#x200B;

Sony is rumored to be buying Crunchyroll which is one of the leading anime streaming services. Sony already owns Funimation so it will have a big chunk of anime titles under its belt. Not sure if they plan to combine the two or keep them separate. They already license a lot of Funimation content to Hulu but I wouldn't be surprised if they started to pull content and force users to their services. If they did I would expect a lot of people to switch. Hulu has no original anime that I'm aware of and Netflix original animes have been mostly dumpster fire. Some good ones here and there but most of it is forgettable. Amazon tried to make their own anime streaming service called Anime Strike but shut it down after a year.

###Where dreams die. Slowly

Had some SPY puts this week so we’re taking our tour of the wreckage around Boomerland in a [Lamborghini Miura P400](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg/1200px-Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg). Tuck them sacks and buckle them balls because I don’t know how to drive a stick. 

GE beat earnings expectations and actually *made* money ($0.06 EPS vs expected -$0.04). Not many saw that coming so the inhabitants of Boomerland popped a few Viagras and started humping the buy button until it shot up on a swing of more than +9% early Wednesday morning from -4.76% to +4.42% before giving up all the week’s gains in the last two hours of trading. Popped back up in time for open on Thursday but promptly got tired and fell asleep. Finished the week down -0.7%. 

XOMMY XOMMY XOM XOM. In a remarkably rational footnote to this confounding covid market, the ground-pounding continues for a company that relies on things and people being moved. Down -3.5% on the week and a staggering -21% on the 3-month chart. 

What’s the mpg on my Lambo, you ask? 14.9 mpg thank you very much; not bad for the era.

IBM, which did a *very* IBM-like thing on the 19th and hit ER expectations on the nose at $2.58 EPS, had an interesting week. International Business Machines’ stock price melted to a low of -7.26% on Wednesday before making a steady climb back up to just -2.4% on the week. Solid showing on Friday; +2.6% on the day. 

UL, the world’s favorite Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, positively shat the bed this week with a loose, bloody stool. For a company that’s been pretty damn rangebound, this week’s -6.24% slide is a stark reminder to hide both your bonds and your dividends because they’re raping everybody. 

Likewise, KO - champions in antiquity of liquid-induced diabetes, also had an unfortunate and smelly accident in the marketplace this week. Down -4.20% on the week to $48.07 per share. Ouch. It took *forever* to get to $50 and fought its balls off to stay above that. Not a good look.

This is getting depressing so let’s do an uplifting one. How about BA? They’re always good for a laugh. Ah, yes; they appear to have died. Down to -12.2% on the week. Whoops.

Could the banking industry perhaps pull us out of this dreadful malaise? Fuck no; sector down 3-4%ish.

HON (Honeywell)? They beat expectations! Down 4.76% on the week. 

Ford? Red.

GM? Red.

PFE. Surely the company on whose shoulders rest the entire world’s hope for a return to normalcy can provide us with a dose of the green stuff. Down -6.8% on the week. Bwoooooooah fuck that’s PFE we’re talking about here.

Very fucking depressing. 

Welp, I guess that’s all for this week’s tour of Boomerland for the week ending October 30th, 2020. Now go hug your loved ones and tell them you made it out alive."
NOW,"I made the DD on CIIC last week, now I am moving onto my next play (EV battery)",1606148641.0,"[I made the CIIC DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwoakc/the_next_ev_play_ciic_and_arrival_merger/) when it was $12, there was no mention of CIIC anywhere (I monitor daily threads). [Today it is at $23.5 and raising.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ciic).

&#x200B;

With all these EV stocks popping up,

# my next play is the merger of $THCB and Microvast

([Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-11-13/tuscan-holdings-corp-announces-intent-to-combine-with-microvast-inc)). You might say, the merger isn't confirmed yet. That is true, but that's how you maximize profit before the news sets in. Bloomberg has never been wrong about any SPAC rumour except once (Topgolf). THCB will be able to sign an extension by Dec 3rd, likely to be beforehand)

Right now, without an agreement confirmation, $THCB has barely popped yet, shares and warrants are still cheap. There is virtually 0 downside risk, THCB shares are currently at $10.44, like most SPACs, you can redeem shares to $10 cash if it fails through, which is unlikely to happen.

&#x200B;

**So what is Microvast?**

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

[Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/microvast-ma-tuscan-holdings/ev-battery-maker-microvast-to-go-public-through-spac-merger-idINL4N2HZ3SI) Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap as fuck right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to \~$20 range.

EDIT: **it is NOT a cannabis/weed stock. It is a SPAC to merge with a EV battery maker.**

&#x200B;

# Reminder: Gonna take a couple weeks before it moons (from merger agreement confirmation), BE PATIENT

NOW,Why WSB is now running the entire equity market - Investment Professional here,1606248913.0,"I am someone who has spent over a decade in finance, first in a hedge fund and then in private equity

If you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds.

And here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.

So why does this matter?

Well, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy low sell high with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued.

There are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum).

This is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.

So thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets. The memes are now real and you are now the captain of Wall Street.

Edit: to all the morons who keep saying I am wrong because passive is not 90% of the market. Yes it’s more like 60-65(passive) 35-40 (active) right now. But what drives price action is the marginal buyer and seller. The total market doesn’t matter worth shit. Grandma with her 20 shares of Ford she plans to gift to Timmy 10 years down the line doesn’t move market price today. 90%+ of the marginal Flow of money today is passive and that sets the price."

The stethoscope is to the Doctor as the sword is to the warrior; and just as the sword was replaced with the firearm, so to does point of care ultrasound (POCUS)

With increasing ease of access to CT and x-ray imaging, the negative effects of radiation exposure have prompted a shift in medicine toward less harmful imaging.

In steps ultrasound. Ultrasound isn’t new of course, but traditionally it has been performed by specialty trained ultrasonographers. it uses sound waves rather than radiation, removing ionizing radiation from the picture. the limitation of the current US model, especially in resource limited or acute care settings, is the time from ordering the study to completion and interpretation by a radiologist (1hr or more) or communities without access to ANY imaging.

US teaching to doctors and advanced practice providers has EXPLODED in the last 3-4 years, with medical schools and residencies integrating US training and fellowships as standard.

In the near future, providers in acute care settings will be expected to utilize US as a diagnostic tool, and it is a very exciting time for many of us.

BUTTERFLY NETWORK has changed the game forever. they offer an US probe that was the first of its kind. it is small, and attached to your phone or tablet and provides very high quality US imaging on demand.

This is HUGE. 

The limitation was cost ($2000). but the cost limitation is over

Yesterday, BUTTERFLY announced their newest generation of POCUS, the IQ+ at the same price as their first generation model.

The first generation model may now be found on ebay by sellers for around ($1000). 

prices are going down and providers now have visual window access orders of magnitude better than the traditional stethoscope.

BUTTERFLY is not yet publicly traded, but it’s main investors are the BILL and Melinda Gates Foundation.

other companies have followed suit that ARE public:

FUJI FILM
GE
SAMSUNG
HITACHI
TOSHIBA

and others have developed their own versions, but none have offered the diagnostic quality at the price of BUTTERFLY.

Forget big pharma. This is the future. be on the lookout..

In my previous post, the maximum downside to purchasing PSTH was about 3.70 a share. Due to the recent drop in PSTH, the maximum downside is now about 11-12%, or roughly 2.50 per share as you can redeem your shares for cash if you decide you don't want to hold through merger. This is not advice, do your own research.

&#x200B;

**The Play: See previous post, I am just buying ordinary shares. PSTH is the ticker, nothing special. If you hold through merger you get 2 long call warrants for every 9 shares. I expect to hear something by year end on the merger, but the SPAC has \~2 years from when they went public.**"

They have an announcement this week and a MASSIVE dip today, after continual growth since they stated they were coming out with some news this weekend. My only regret is I didn't buy earlier but I'm loaded with $50c 12/18.

&#x200B;

Thank me on Monday and DO NOT SELL until early December once it goes $60+ as the big boys will buy on next week. Also, no hedge fund that has positions in it has sold, 0. Let me repeat that, 0 of the big boys have left their positions since it IPO'd.

NOW,The time for HYLN is now,1604326560.0,"I got into Hyliion back when it was trading under a SPAC in July, at around $24, then jumped out after it doubled. Now, it's being shorted to shit, but none of the goddamn fundamentals have changed, so I'm going all in once more.

The tl;dr reason I believe this will go up is because it already went up without any of your autist strength. The gay automods banned the SPAC ticker--I don't even know if I can say it here--which means this thing doubled on Robinhood, StockTwits, and WeBull 'tards alone.  

Overview: Hyliion makes natural gas power trains whose performance is unmatched by any other product. [Here's Wegman's waxing poetic about 'em](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/).

Jerome Guillen: Yes. We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, 
Megachargers, we realized that 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars
 is not going to be enough for Semi. So we're looking for something much more 
powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast the Semi as 
during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next 
break, yes. So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi. 
That's the goal.

We're working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard 
infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Yes. Probably, 
all I can say at this point, yes. We're not working on...Just we're not working in 
isolation. Yes, we're trying to -- **we have to invent it because it doesn't 
exist.**

NOW,Trump (Through Mnuchin) Is Trying To Turn Off The Printers And CRash Stonks- Start Hedging Now!,1605836802.0,"Here's the article:

[https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526785-mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-455-billion-in-unspent-covid-emergency-funds](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526785-mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-455-billion-in-unspent-covid-emergency-funds)

&#x200B;

Judging by the title itself it doesn't seem like a big deal, after all, its only $455bil but I'm gonna break it down for you people as to why you should start to SERIOUSLY consider buying UVXY calls or SPY puts (I know, super gay). 

Since the start of the pandemic, one of the key programs set up by the FED is its key lending facilities. These facilities were set up to cover virtually ALL aspects of the credit markets from corporate debt to credit cards. Pretty much any debt that can be securitized, these facilities were set up so that the FED (through their SPVs) can purchase these CDOs or ETFs and provide liquidity to the credit markets and raise investor confidence. Now, the only way the FED can continue to purchase these debt assets is if the Treasury continues to support the FED by providing funds to cover any potential losses the facilities may incur ([https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus)). The amount of money the Treasury can provide is stated in the CARES act and is $455billion dollars, the same amount as stated in the title.

Right now, Mnuchin is pulling that amount from the FED and is therefore refusing to extend the lending facilities past year end, which means the market now knows that the backstop they enjoyed from the FED since March is running out and the confidence they had that the FED will support virtually all corners of the credit market is now shattered. Even if Mnuchin only wants to pull the plug on 5 of the nine facilities, it wouldn't matter because investor confidence is now gone. 

Expect yields in credit markets to rise and VIX to spike. We might even have a minor replay of March.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Trump is stabbing us in the back by sending Mnuchin to kneecap the FED's ability to print. Start hedging your positions now!"

NOW,Best stocks to buy for the great recovery rotation now vaccines are coming,1604952514.0,"For the last 6+ months, people have been rotating money into stay at home stocks (eg tech) like crazy due to the pandemic but now with vaccines (ie life getting back to normal) in sight, there is going to be a great rotation back. What's happening today is just the beginning.

I owned a lot of the usual recovery suspects already: SPG, CCL, BA, EB, TCOM, etc.  They did really well today and I expect them to continue to outperform the broader market in the next few months.

But there are still uncovered gems so I did some digging.  I think CIM is going to do really well.  It was $22ish in Feb.  Today, only a 7-8% bump to $9.49 which is still super cheap considering it got to $11.64 during the head fake recover in June.

You can buy the shares for dividend.  Currently $0.30/quarter after cut in June.  So 12.6% yield at today's price.  With vaccines in sight, my guess is dividend is safe at that level.  Once dividend recovers to prepandemic $0.50/quarter, that's 21% yield if you buy at today's price.

Options are still cheap too.  Last price for March 2021 12C was $0.09.  Last price for Jan 2022 $12 was $0.45 and $15 was $0.15.  I'm sure by Jan 2022, everything will be back to normal.  Again, share price was $22 prepandemic.  Seems like a no brainer.

Hello again. SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!

# Introduction:

The market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...

I am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.

I've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.

I will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!

&#x200B;

**Primary Bearish Premises:**

**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**

**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**

**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**

**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**

**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**

**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**

**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**

&#x200B;

# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued

There are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.

What I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie ""future earnings"" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.

There are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.

https://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43

For those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.

Note that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.

This is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still ""buying the dip"" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.

# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes

I'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.

https://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af

As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.

If this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.

# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money

I know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.

The Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.

What the Fed ""prints"" is called ""reserves.""

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)

So what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.

This is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is ""backstopping"" stocks, or that the Fed will not ""allow"" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.

Just think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???

# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary

Quantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.

Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.

In fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about ""creating liquidity,"" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!

Why would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)

See, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.

Only when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in ""forward guidance."" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.

The Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.

# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting

The question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.

**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**

Real Estate lending is booming, you say? Not so....

Note: The decline near the end doesn't represent growth in credit, but represents a reduction in the RATE of tightening.

**Consumer Demand for Loans is SHRINKING:**

# Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks

If you are like me, you look forward to the H.8 data every Friday from the Fed (yeah right haha). A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.

[Source: https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/h8\/current\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)

Meanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.

# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High

I bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?

# Conclusion:

**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!

Also anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.

**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**

AMD,AMD is an absolute STEAL at $75,1604149460.0,"I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up in a few days. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.

&#x200B;

So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:

&#x200B;

[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)

First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.

&#x200B;

[**35B Xilinx Takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMfNlCZPsBQ)

Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:

[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)

[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)

Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits.

&#x200B;

[**New GPU Reveal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpgu-cTjyM)

Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**

This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: [He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ackqH7a40)

&#x200B;

**RISK**

Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.

AMD,AMD to the MOOOOoooonnn!,1605048991.0,Listen up bitches.  I was bored pondering my thoughts and my wittle autistic brain started running wild.  It got me thinking.  AMD currently has a market cap of 90 bill and assuming they continue to dominate then they will most certainly replace Intel who has a market cap of double round 186.  Assuming this I concur AMD will be roughly the same size as Intel in 5 years and be double what it is now giving it a stock price around 160.  However assuming they continue to innovate they will sport a higher pe ratio.  Intel has a pe of 10 while AMD currently holds at 100.  Lets be bearish and assume AMD trades at a pe of 50 in 5 years.  Given that multiple of 5 lets multiply that by 160 and bam!  I have a price target of 800 for AMD by 2025.  Does this math even make sense or am I just retarded?

AMD,Too late for AMD calls?,1603638367.0,"Earnings on Tuesday, definitely expected to be up, but I waited pretty long, and while you autists think stomk only go up, AMD has been trending up for a hot minute.

All leaks and rumors put amd on par with Nvidia in traditional rasterization, and with Nvidia in a slight lead in hardware based raytracing. It's all but confirmed that AMD's tease was not their highest end GPU, and what they did show was on par with the 3080. Most leaks say that AMD will be competitive with 3090 as well.

Combo that with the fact that zen 3 is looking to be a price to performance champion, and Intel is so unconfident in their next generation that they announced it in a fucking blog post, I think it's safe to say AMD is going up, but I wonder how much they're pre-inflated for the earnings call on Tuesday.

So calls for sure, but calls for 30th or calls for sometime in November when both gpus and cpus are officially announced?

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk, my velvety smooth brain is unfamiliar with how markets trend before earnings reports; also broke bitch 20yo so buying both is probably a no. Don't really care about massiev gains, I just want to be safely in the green and probably sell on Tuesday, or a bit later as long as the leaks stay positive.

Bullish AF.

If AMD starts snatching up world records from Nvidia like this indicates they will, you can expect the stock to get back into it's meme-hype glory days and start mooning again over the winter.

It's been about 7 years since AMD had any meaningful record in GPU's. This is gonna be another paradigm shift.

Anyone with a brain knew to exit at open today, and thank god I did. I know many of you retards will be saying: 

""Oh SMOO765, BIG NAVI will save us, gay bears will tremble at their feet tomorrow""

And that's where I'm going to need you to unplug your brain and wake the fuck up. To anyone holding AMD calls, I sure as hell hope you sold at open today. Historically, AMD has NEVER, EVER gone up from a GPU announcement. Furthermore, BIG NAVI benchmarks are not nearly as good as NVDA (no surprise). 

This XLNX deal is great for actual investors, but for all you retards with weeklies... you're about to get bent over. Yes, I took a massive loss today. Yes, you can call me retarded. But, NO ONE could have predicted what would have happened this morning, and IMO it was a solid swing trade. You can't always win in the market, it's just how it works.

Got some interesting info for yall asses.  I have a friend who works in cyber security and is into gaming, and he hit me up today with some interesting dd.  I dont know shit about this stuff but this is basically his word so take this info for what its worth.

Basically AMD just announced its going to be coming out with new gpu that, in his words, is either matching or beating  NVIDEA with less power and for cheaper.  This is huge news because up until now NVIDEA has apparently dominated this space.  He states ""NVIDIAs top GPU the RTX 3090 sells for $1,499.99 and draws 350W and its one of the largest GPUs ever in terms of physical size. AMD took some shots. They released the RX 6900XT for $999.99 only draws 300W and it's the same size as your average GPU.  The only thing the 3090 has is more memory 24Gb vs 16GB but honestly that shouldn't matter.""  He further states ""They should be getting a lot of sales on both cpu and GPUs because they also made this technology that when you pair one of their cpu with one of their GPUs you automatically unlock this feature NVIDIA and intel cannot provide.  Same feature that's going to allow the new consoles to load games so quickly and just boost the performance.""  He finishes ""Streams of revenue PS5, XboxseriesX, CPUs (consumer laptops/desktops, high end gaming/workstations, servers google + Microsoft deals) and now GPUs.""

1. Basically market  has a whole bunch of calls and puts --> PremarketSo there is nothing you can do, unless your a big time investor with access.
2. It skips through all the calls/puts and goes to 83
3. All the calls and puts before 80 are cleared and not initiated.
4. A large call is placed with 6000 volume
5. Price continues to reject this larger order and stays around 83 markThat would make sense because  the market doesn't know what to do, hence the really low volume.
6. Before Market close, that call was increased.
7. Premarket accepts that Call

Whoever is in that call is now richer.

AMD,Xilinx prospects going forward. Buying Xilinx vs. AMD shares.,1603823073.0,"Do y'all think Xilinx will go up down or remain flat at this point? I am interesting in buying AMD. But assuming this deal closes, it seems like a better value to buy Xlininx shares before they are converted to AMD shares. It costs less and gets you the AMD shares for a better valuation it seems. Currently Xilinx shares are \~$123. They are worth 1.7 amd shares if the deal closes. 123/1.7 = \~72.40 per amd share which is better than the current amd share price of \~$78.

&#x200B;

So, the question becomes, do we think Xilinx will go up down or remain flat? I might just DCA into it. Also does anyone know how likely it is for deals like this to close or fall apart? Lastly, is there a good estimate of when/how soon the deal is supposed to close?"

&#x200B;

Found this to be an excellent read and would love to hear what /investing has to say. Full article below: 

&#x200B;

It is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of “value” investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (“book”) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as “eyeballs” or “engagement”. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up “the opportunity”.

Plenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America’s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals—stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.

This would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today’s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

The job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock’s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital—from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company’s worth. A different approach is required—not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.

## Graham’s cracker

To understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds—notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities—which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.

This new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published “Security Analysis” (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham’s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. “The Intelligent Investor”, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham’s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.

Underpinning it all is an important distinction—between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm’s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.

The approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm’s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a “more reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism”. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.

The enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham’s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world’s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett’s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University’s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.

It helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency—and a validation of the value approach.

All this has had a lasting impact. Most investors “almost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say”, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that “value” has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind “growth” stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.

In Graham’s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.

In service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles—assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google’s search algorithm or Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company’s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company’s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can’t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.

## A beancounter’s nightmare

There are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles’ treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.

The treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset—either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as “goodwill”. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.

The second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are “non-rival” goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.

In their book “Capitalism Without Capital” Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm’s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade—Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China—have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects—think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).

Physical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable—hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.

The third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.

The distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst’s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first—call it the “steady state”—assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities—essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm’s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.

The nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. “You can’t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,” says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm—and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.

Picking winners in an intangible economy—and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success—is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.

## Up, up and away

Properly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham’s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.

The economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that’s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy."
AMD,One more thing AAPL event coming,1604339380.0,
AMD,"What is a True Market Leader (TML) + And how to find them? (Ex. SHOP 2016-2020, ZM 2020, AAPL 2005-2012",1604793787.0," 

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

---

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

---

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up."
AMD,NIO stock today,1605123231.0,
AMD,MRVL next great chip play,1606051877.0,"Ok so my first official DD but I’ve got some conviction around it so I thought I’d get the beautiful masses to opine

My thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:

1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets

2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That’s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players

3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. 

AND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. 

Here’s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:
Marvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message

4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. 


With earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it’s potential huge value that MRVL hasn’t run on. 

I’m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I’ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. 

100 12/11 46c
50 1/21/22 50c 

TLDR: buy MRVL. You’ll thank me later


Side note: I’m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I’d love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see."

AMD,Apple M1 chip long term prospects to growth,1605851027.0,"FOR\* growth

Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.

&#x200B;

Tech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.

Seriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling.

&#x200B;

The M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).

&#x200B;

Could licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.

&#x200B;

Seriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.

Now in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time?

&#x200B;

Also where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.

AMD,Virgin Galactic plans to open new ticket sales after Richard Branson’s flight this winter.,1604980293.0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-05/virgin-galactic-sees-new-ticket-sales-after-branson-s-space-trip



Virgin Galactic has made progress towards the commercialization of space with the recent announcement of the test flight in 2 weeks for FAA certification.  The second test flight will have 4 mission specialist to make sure it is a smooth ride.  Both flights so a suborbital flight for passengers to enjoy the experience of space.  

This will lead to Richard Branson to fly up this winter (Q1 2021).  After Richard flies up the company will open up ticket sales.  

Important because after a 16 year journey of research and development they will finally start commercial operations and within a few months now assuming the two test flights go well.  Once commercial operations start then comes the task of scaling the business and on a large scale with multiple spaceports and a entire fleet of spaceships which are currently in various stages of development.  They will have 2 spaceships operational by the time Richard Branson flies up."
AMD,Im getting ass raped by this market crash,1603728855.0,"So long story short it looked like it was going to be a good day today so I YOLO’d my entire portfolio in AAPL, SNAP, APPS, and AMD calls and now im down like 20%, and honestly I don’t know how much longer I can endure this pain I just want to make back my losses but everyday it feels like the market is going against me. I don’t have any day trades left so I have to just fucking hold and hope that I don’t get analed by a big fat red dildo candle stick tomorrow morning"
AMD,Want to make money? Buy Dell,1606087017.0,"Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)

Now the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. 

Now I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!

But, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/

They have a 3 sections.

VMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.

I believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)

Also NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.

Now onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.

Now Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%

Also there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded

AMD,"Sold UBER to buy INTC, AMA",1606191230.0,"Basically I have been holding Uber stock for less than a year but more than a week so the shares started to itch and I had to scratch them, sold 95% at 46.37 to buy intel at 44.99 (fucking blue chip value play bullshit I know, could have bought calls like a Chad ). So anyway I looked at the stonks after a few days of binge drinking with hookers, and waddya know, fucking Uber keeps on fucking mooning, past $50 now. Total rocket ship. 

And you know the best part? Looking back at the retards who told me, when I was buying around $26, that Uber was definitely going bankrupt, etc. Like these bro-king Tech Chads weren't going to Rockefeller the shit out of their bullshit monopoly and manipulate an election to keep making money. Truckloads of money. You know they barely even pay these Uber drivers a living wage, right? Wall Street loves this story. It's a badass story, and everyone likes it, actually. 

And yeah I'm a small timer, literally only had 20 shares. Not even worth the screenshot lol. But I have skills. I pick winners, and believe that I can do it again. Stay tuned for free dollars!"
