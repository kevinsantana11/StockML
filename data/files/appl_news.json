Reviewers praised the  iPhone  12 mini''s size and full feature set, but were disappointed about the device''s battery life. Photo via The Verge Size The Verge ''s Dieter Bohn believes that surprisingly little is lost on the iPhone 12 mini''s smaller display: Despite the smaller screen size, you don''t miss out on as much as you might expect. Compared to the regular iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch screen, there are maybe one or two lines of text that are cut off. What you actually miss out on is that sense of immersion you can get from a bigger screen when youre playing a game or watching a movie. Those were the only times this screen felt cramped. TechCrunch ''s Matthew Panzarino similarly noticed that the display size felt surprisingly similar to that of the iPhone 11 : If you look at this and an iPhone 11, because of the way that the screen is rendered, youre going to see pretty much the same amount of content.",

Crucially, the executives explained that Apple sees camera technology as a holistic union of hardware and software. The interview reveals that Apple sees its main goal for smartphone photography as allowing users to \"stay in the moment, take a great photo, and get back to what they''re doing,\" without being distracted by the technology behind it. McCormack explained that while professional photographers go through a process to fine-tune and edit their photos, Apple is attempting to refine that process down to the single action of capturing a frame. \"We replicate as much as we can to what the photographer will do in post,\" McCormack said. \"There are two sides to taking a photo: the exposure, and how you develop it afterwards. We use a lot of computational photography in exposure, but more and more in post and doing that automatically for you.",

Bloomberg reports that several weeks ago Apple found Pegatron had been falsifying paperwork to cover up the violations of Apple''s code of conduct for suppliers. Specifically, the Taiwanese manufacturer had misclassified student workers, which allowed some to work nights and overtime. Employees reportedly then \"went to extraordinary lengths\" to cover up the violations. \"Pegatron misclassified the student workers in their program and falsified paperwork to disguise violations of our Code, including allowing students to work nights and/or overtime and in some cases to perform work unrelated to their major,\" Apple said in a statement to Bloomberg. \"The individuals at Pegatron responsible for the violations went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms.\" Pegatron said the violations took place at its Shanghai and Kunshan campuses in eastern China and that students working night shifts, over-time, and in positions unrelated to their majors were \"not in compliance with local rules and regulations.\" Pegatron has since fired the manager who oversaw the student worker program. \"Upon discovery of this non-compliant activity, we immediately took the student workers off production lines and worked with our customer and third-party experts to make appropriate arrangements for them to return to their homes or schools with proper compensation alongside all necessary support and care,\" Pegatron said in a statement.",

The palm-sized iBoy is an homage to Apple''s iPod Classic, first released in 2001. Design wise, the iBoy is a cross between an iPod and a robot, and it makes for a fun desktop toy or shelf decoration. iBoy''s body looks similar to a classic iPod, with a fake screen that houses a robot face and a functional click wheel with buttons that can be pressed. The wheel in the middle turns just like on an iPod, and all four buttons around the wheel can be pressed in, as can the middle button. The buttons have a satisfying click that will remind iPod fans of their classic music players, and the weight is also similar to an original iPod. iBoy''s buttons were my favorite part because in addition to being a cute desktop accessory, iBoy is also fun to fidget with. None of iBoy''s components are functional electronics, but the detail of the design is impressive.",

Its Apples most adaptable system, capable of doing almost everything you need, and is the iPad to get this season. Whats inside? The new iPad Air uses an A14X processor (Apple Silicon). It provides a 10.9-inch display and has a Touch ID sensor underneath the top and one of the side buttons. It carries a 12-megapixel rear camera. In contrast, the last generation iPad Air offered a 10.5-inch display, used an A12 Bionic chip, carried an 8-megapixel rear camera and had a familiar Touch ID Home button system. The design marries more to the squarer design of earlier iPhones, but the tablet is light and durable with its 100% recycled aluminium frame. It has slim bezels, flat edges and is easy to hold, particularly as the tablet weighs just under a pound. That slight weight makes a real difference if you hold it for extensive periods.

Mann''s review a must-read review for anyone who is interested in the iPhone 12 Pro Max for its camera, because this is the first year in some time that Apple has introduced different cameras in the Pro and Pro Max models. The Pro Max has a larger sensor and larger pixels, plus a different telephoto lens. Despite the improvements in the iPhone 12 Pro Max over the Pro, Mann said that in his testing, he could \"barely see a difference\" between the two iPhones in most lighting conditions. The exception was semi-low-light scenes, such as just after sunset or in a night urban scene. In these situations, the iPhone 12 Pro needed two seconds of Night Mode recording, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max needed just one second because of the larger amount of light let in by the sensor.",

We''ll be sharing more detailed review roundups for each device shortly, but in the meantime, we''ve quickly gathered a handful of unboxing videos and reviews of the devices below. There are also unboxing videos for Apple''s upcoming MagSafe Duo Charger and Leather Sleeve accessories . The first thing that comes to mind with these devices is size. Despite having a 5.4-inch display, the iPhone 12 mini is smaller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, as the latter device has thicker bezels and a Home button. By contrast, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the largest iPhone ever, sporting a massive 6.7-inch display. Key features of both devices include a new flat-edge design, 5G connectivity, a faster A14 Bionic chip, a new MagSafe system with easy-to-attach magnetic accessories, improved durability, and camera upgrades. The camera improvements go much further on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which features a telephoto lens with a larger /2.2 aperture, sensor-shift optical image stabilization, and a LiDAR Scanner for improved low-light photography.",

Image: The Verge With a 6.7-inch display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the largest iPhone ever, eclipsing the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max. Given that the iPhone 12 Pro has already launched, this review roundup focuses on what sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max apart from its smaller sibling, including its larger display, more advanced camera improvements, and longer battery life. Large Display With its super-sized 6.7-inch display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max won''t be for everyone, as The Verge ''s Nilay Patel explains: The combination of the size and flat sides basically demands a case to make it easier to hold, which makes the whole thing even bigger. It''s still workable, but it is right on the edge of being too big. I think the size is a reflection of increased choice: this year Apple has more phone sizes available than ever before, including the diminutive iPhone 12 mini, so it had the ability to push the Max even farther.",

Humorously, the event ended with a brief appearance from John Hodgman, known as the PC guy in Apple''s iconic \"Get a Mac\" ads from 2006-2009. Matching his persona from those ads, Hodgman attempted to justify his louder operation and inferior battery life as a PC compared to the new fanless MacBook Air with up to 18 hours of battery life. Hodgman can be seen at the 45:27 mark of the Apple Event. We''ve also embedded a user-uploaded clip below, but it might be removed at some point by Apple: Justin Long, who played the Mac in the ad campaign, did not make an appearance today. Apple''s new MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini with the Apple-designed M1 chip are now available to order on Apple.com and through the Apple Store app, and they will be available in stores starting November 17.",

However, new research by Parrot Analytics shows that the streaming service''s \"second wave\" of original programs was much more popular with audiences than its launch titles, suggesting that it is gaining momentum after a lackluster start . \"Defending Jacob\" was Apple''s biggest original series so far based on viewership, desire, and engagement.

        "summary": "The M1 MacBook Air , 13-inch MacBook Pro , and Mac mini are the first of Apple''s Macs to support WiFi 6, or 802.11ax. WiFi 6 support started rolling out in Apple devices with the March 2020 launch of the iPad Pro , but Apple did not include the feature in Macs refreshed earlier in the year. WiFi 6 brings faster speeds, expanded network capacity, lower latency, and improved power efficiency, plus it is ideal for homes where there are many WiFi-connected smart home products in use. With more and more routers starting to offer WiFi 6 performance, the update is a welcome change to the Mac lineup. None of the Macs refreshed today got major design changes, but the MacBook Air features an updated row of function keys that gains Spotlight search instead of Launchpad, and a dictation key and a Do Not Disturb key in place of the function keys that used to be available for adjusting keyboard brightness. The Fn key at the bottom of the keyboard has also been updated to serve as an emoji key for bringing up emoji on the MacBook Air.",

Battery life is even better in the new MacBook Pro, which has a 58.2 WHr battery. The battery lasts for up to 17 hours when browsing the web and up to 20 hours when watching a movie using the Apple TV app. The prior-generation MacBook Pro lasted for up to 10 hours when browsing the web and up to 10 hours when watching movies. Long battery life is enabled through the four high-efficiency cores that are included in the M1. Apple says that alone, the four cores offer similar performance as the dual-core MacBook Air but at much lower power, providing an efficient way to run simple tasks like checking email or browsing the web.",

        "summary": "The newly announced MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models that Apple announced today are equipped with the same 8-core M1 chip that also offers an integrated GPU, with Apple offering no CPU upgrades. There is, however, a GPU upgrade available for the MacBook Air. By default, the MacBook Air ships with an M1 chip with a 7-core GPU, while the MacBook Pro has the same M1 chip with an 8-core GPU. If you choose the $1,249 MacBook Air model with a 512GB SSD, it upgrades to an 8-core GPU instead of the default 7-core GPU, but there is no custom configuration option to choose the lower tier model with the upgraded 8-core GPU option. Both the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro can be customized with more RAM and more storage space. The Mac mini also has the same M1 chip with 8-core GPU as the MacBook Pro with no GPU/CPU upgrade option available. The new models are available today and will start shipping out next week.

Instead, Cook said that future Macs will boast ARM-based designs. Hardly a surprise, Apple has been using in-house designed chips on the iPhone for nearly 10-years now. And seeing as how Apple''s line of A-x chips routinely trounce what Android brings to the table, both in terms of power and energy efficiency, there''s a lot of anticipation regarding what an Apple-designed processor will look like on a full-fledged machine. Well, with Apple holding a special Mac-themed media event today, the wait is finally over. Just a few moments ago, Apple unveiled its M1 processor, the company''s first SoC for the Mac designed for improved efficiency and breathtaking performance. Following that, Apple unveiled the first new Mac with an M1 processor, a brand new MacBook Air. The new 13-inch MacBook Air delivers 5x faster graphics performance than its predecessor, the biggest leap we''ve seen on the MacBook Air line to date.",

Apple says the 5-nanometer M1 chip supports Thunderbolt and USB 4 support, and boasts the world''s fastest integrated graphics with a 16-core Neural Engine that can process 11 trillion operations per second. The new Mac mini continues Apple''s transition away from Intel processors in Macs. Back in June, Apple revealed its plans to begin using its own custom Apple Silicon processors in Macs, promising industry-leading performance per watt. At the time, Apple said that the transition would take about two years to be completed. In the interim, Apple teased new Intel-based Macs in development, including an updated 27-inch iMac released in August. Apple said that it will continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come. This story is part of our coverage of Apple''s ongoing \"One More Thing\" event today. ",

Apple did not, however, add new camera hardware to the two machines, and the technical specifications pages continue to list the same 720p camera used in prior-generation models. Camera quality, especially in the MacBook Air, has been something that Mac owners have complained about for years now. Apple has gone through many generations of the MacBook Air without adding any new camera hardware. Apple says the M1 chip improves MacBook camera quality with better noise reduction, greater dynamic range, improved auto white balance, and ML-enhanced face detection so users \"look their best during video calls,\" but we''ll need to wait to see the camera tested out to see if there''s a notable difference between this model and the prior model.

Because the M1 MacBook Pro models are replacing the lower-end models, it''s worth noting that the machines have just two USB-C ports that offer Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, while the higher-end models have four ports. The Mac mini models with M1 chips, priced at $699 and $899 depending on storage, are also being sold alongside an older Intel-equipped Mac mini model. The MacBook Air models, however, use M1 chips across the board and Apple no longer offers a MacBook Air with an Intel chip. Despite the transition to Apple Silicon , Apple plans to continue to support Intel chips for years to come. Apps built using the new Universal App binary will be able to run on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs going forward.",

Typically, when a company makes such a claim, it publishes a benchmark, a performance test or actual details on what its basing that marketing claim on. This to prevent lawyers from launching out of missile silos across the world. Apples website restates the claim by stating: M1 is faster than the chips in 98 percent of PC laptops sold in the past year. But the site also includes a detail note that states: Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using preproduction 13-inch MacBook Pro systems with Apple M1 chip and 16GB of RAM. Performance measured using select industry-standard benchmarks. PC configurations from publicly available sales data over the last 12 months.",

Leaker Fudge ( @choco_bit ) shared what might be an AirTag carrying accessory in a Saddle Brown color. A patent for an ''AirTag'' accessory As Fudge points out, the design of the ring is similar to what''s been seen in an AirTag patent, but it is something that''s easy to fake and therefore the legitimacy of the accessory in the photo cannot be confirmed. Fudge suggests taking the leak with a \"bit of salt\" because it''s easy to reproduce, but if legitimate, this could be our first look at an AirTag accessory. Another AirTag accessory patent image AirTags themselves are believed to be small, round discs that can be attached to items to allow those items to be tracked in the Find My app right alongside iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple devices. A rendering of what AirTags could look like There have been a lot of mixed rumors on when AirTags first launched, and there''s still no clear word on when we might see them.",

These best-selling wireless noise cancelling earphones dropped to $199 on Prime Day 2020, and they flew off of Amazon''s shelves at that all-time low price. Now, thanks to an early Black Friday 2020 deal on Amazon, AirPods Pro are on sale for even less! Apple''s various AirPods models go on sale all the time these days at Amazon. It would''ve been crazy to imagine Apple''s most popular accessories on sale with any discount a few short years ago. But now that Apple partners with Amazon to sell its various products, discounts are no surprise to anyone anymore. Of course, some discounts on Apple products are more noteworthy than others. Apple''s insanely popular AirPods Pro cost $250 if you buy them at an Apple store or from Apple''s online shop. They''re worth every penny, mind you, by why pay $250 when Amazon always has them on sale at a discount? You can typically find AirPods Pro discounted to $219 at Amazon, which is a solid $30 in savings.",

The world''s biggest sales event  eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States  spans four main days this year, and so far has brought sellers 20 times as many orders by value than Amazon.com Inc''s two-day global Prime Day last month. Such is its size that its performance is widely considered indicative of China''s post-virus economic recovery. \"Because of Covid-19, many Chinese cannot go overseas,\" vice president Liu Bo told reporters. \"This actually stimulates online consumption.\" So far, the performance is likely a relief for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd after losing about 10% of its market value last week when regulators scuppered the listing of fintech affiliate Ant Group. The firm began sales early this year to give lesser-known brands more exposure.",

Kuo has previously suggested that these notebooks may feature Mini-LED displays. 16-inch MacBook Pro: Earlier this month, Bloomberg ''s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu reported that a new 16-inch MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon is in development, but the report did not provide a release timeframe.",

Epic Games promptly filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of anti-competitive actions. In September, Apple filed a counter suit to stop the game maker from using its own payment system for Fortnite. Apple also accused Epic of theft and sought extra monetary damages beyond breach of contract. In October, Epic filed a motion ahead of Tuesday''s hearing seeking the dismissal of Apple''s counterclaims of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and conversion, along with its punitive damages bid. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted Epic Games'' motion for judgement, throwing out Apple''s two claims for lost App Store fees and other monetary damages. \"This is a high-stakes breach of contract case and an antitrust case and that''s all in my view,\" Gonzalez told Apple''s lawyers, according to Bloomberg . \"You can''t just say it''s independently wrongful.",
